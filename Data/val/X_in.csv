The only reason I'm not gone is my SO. See above. I could never tell her this of course. But I couldn't do it just because of how much it would hurt her. If anything ever happens to her I'll just have no reason to go on. I barely do anyways.,I'm in your prayers bro. Remember your not alone.,0,,,
Everyday I wake up I look forward to going back to bed. A dream world is better than my reality,"It's not about what you do at work though it's what you do with your time outside of work. Most people's dreams don't come true no, that doesn't mean you should just waste away in a pitiful existence. Find excitement in things. Work hard. Achieve things. See progress. I've been in your place, completely cynical and want nothing to do with the way that society feels we should be. The truth is, you can find comfort in being yourself and falling into where you should be. Dreams of things exist because people see the start of something and then only the end of it (being famous, having lost all that weight etc...).

Mental Health support. Mom says try harder. A doctor prescribes me pills. A councillor gives me kindergarten-level reading material and handouts. The internet gives me a phone number. Friends give me absence. The psychiatric ward gives me a doctor. But repeat after me... I have mental health support.,"Oh I know. In my opinion the true reason that you, me and about 90% of people with depression feels the way you portrayed in this post is because out of all those people who are support. no one really understands on a deep, emotional, and philosophical level how this disorder ruins your life and makes it miserably painful. The ONLY way you know is if you have experienced it yourself. Once you get truly depressed you enter the void. Some people are only in that void for some brief time, while clinically depressed people like ourselves live in this void. That support group doesn't speak our language. That's the fucking problem. They don't know the void. They can only read about the void, but they don't live in it. The support group approaches depression in the same way that males know what it's like to go through childbirth (no this is not a political push either way). It's just stating, THEY DONT but they can read all about it and try to imagine the pain, but they can never truly feel it. The subjective nature of emotions and life makes it beyond Fucking difficult to find people who know what you are truly talking about at your personal level.",0,,,
i shouldn’t be allowed to be close to people emotionally. i hurt her  i hurt her  its all my fault  she hates me  its irreparable i hate myself  i shoudnt be allowed to get close  all i do is hurt others  all i do is bring pain,"Whoa, easy. Whoever she is, and whatever you did, chances are not as irreparable as you think. Time will heal most wounds. And if it is really irreparable, then you move on. One incident is not indicative of your worth as a human being, nor does one opinion determine whether you are good or bad. It might hurt to move on, like *really* hurt, but alright. normal.",0,,,

"Yesterday was the worst day of my life, but compared to today, yesterday was good.. This has been my every day for the last years of my life. I needed only one thing to be right in life, so that I could hold on to it. And now that there is nothing, I don't know what to do because I feel I am nothing.","It's a terrible feeling when you try to hold on to even the most minuscule things that bring you any slight amount of joy, and one by one those things get taken from you.  What I try to do is work back on a route to the thing that would lead to getting the one thing that could be right. i.e. something that costs money makes you happy, but you don't make enough money; need a way to make more money; dedicate all free time to applying for better work. Or, feel lonely and haven't got anybody; need to find somebody to stop feeling like that; need to know best places to find somebody; research ways to meet people and put self into that situation. Or feel worthless; being of use to someone or something would make me feel less worthless; dedicate myself to making myself of use to someone who needs somebody; use free time aiding charity or institution where people need you, and you can feel needed.  Honestly, I know it's not that easy a fix, and there will be more bumps to overcome. One of my larger problems is isolation and loneliness, and even having looked at places to go, I still haven't found the courage to put myself into a situation to meet people. But generating a simple starting point where you can do something easily achievable, even just through reading online about how to get started, can make you feel proactive and start to get you into a more productive feeling that maybe it won't be like that forever, and that there is a physical, tangible, mortal way to deal with the situation. So, I would recommend pick a small goal that CAN lead to some form of happiness and work towards that, rather than try to envision this great milestone of achieving happiness in one big leap. Helps you take it day by day a little easier, and I hope that would make each new day, if not better, at least consistent for you. Feel better soon, bud.",0,"It's a terrible feeling when you try to hold on to even the most minuscule things that bring you any slight amount of joy, and one by one those things get taken from you.|","It's a terrible feeling when you try to hold on to even the most minuscule things that bring you any slight amount of joy, and one by one those things get taken from you.","It's a terrible feeling when you try to hold on to even the most minuscule things that bring you any slight amount of joy, and one by one those things get taken from you."

What can I do to help my wife with her depression?. She's been in a funk for a while now and there's no end in sight. I thought I would just let her ride it out but I can't stand to see her like this. Any help would be great.,"That's really hard! I would encourage you in whatever efforts you take, to focus on compassionate presence, rather than simply solving a problem. Your present company, your listening ear, your genuine love for her is likely to be more helpful than if she starts to feel like she's just a problem that you're trying to solve.  Beyond that, sometimes we need a little push to get counseling, or just eat a bit better, or get outside. Those things don't usually solve the problem in isolation, but they can help build her positive momentum. You can't be her savior, but you can help build a ramp towards something.",0,,,

How could I be happy if nobody is happy with me?. And why would I want to live on?,"Hi there, you know that is a very good question and I used to have similar thoughts as you. I now have a question to ask you, why would other be happy with you when you are not happy with yourself? The thing is, we need to develop self love and self care first. Because without it, we will be too dependent on others and that becomes burdensome because no one's life is perfect and they all have their own issues to deal with. Even though other people wants to love you and support you, they can only do it to a certain extent. The rest of the void that you have inside of you can only be filled by yourself. I know you don't feel it but being able to learn to self love is the key to happiness because that is when you feel like your life is in your control again, not on others. I would recommend you to google how to self love or seek therapy to talk this over and find out what your root cause is.

I want to die. That's all I have to say,"Most of us on this subreddit have been/are there. I know i have. I tend to dwell on the past far too often and besides it's obvious drawbacks it does have one advantage. Remembering the time i did want to die and how I thought there was no other way out. But I decided to live and I haven't actually wanted to die since. Sure things suck, most of the time for longer than we'd like but there are alot of things that make life on this planet right now worth living. I personally am not religious. I think once your dead it's lights out and I very much enjoy consciousness. I only felt what it was like living without it once or twice and those were not pleasant experiences. I'm still technically Depressed, I have been most of my life and likely will be until it's over or I find what it is i need to do with myself to get there. What helped me go from uber frustrated to content is to continue to evolve. I cut off everyone i knew and reevaluated what I want in life... Apparently it's living in a van and not staying anywhere long enough to feel stagnant. I'm not at all a people person and i have a family full of happy go lucky dimwits who talk nonsense and gossip repeating the same routine like that i what life is. That's not what i want. To be happy you need to forget about everyone and their bullshit, and be who you are where you are. Experience what life is, don't waste it and don't throw it away before you've lived it fully. I'm stuck right now, been hibernating as my little brothers personal housekeeper because my anxiety drives me to near agoraphobia. But once i get out of here I'll take all the lessons I've learned on /r/vandwellers and start my life as i know it should be and hopefully that brings me piece of mind for once. That's what works for me, but if your not an antisocial INTP then you might not want to live in a van lol. But I'm sure there is some way you see life should be... There's an entire world out there, look at the room around you and remember that's less than a microbe in the grand scheme of things.

Can someone who has been through depression describe what it is like to be done with it?. I just want to know what awaits us one day.,"I saw your post several hours ago and I've been thinking all afternoon about what you asked. I'm not sure if I can fully explain the shift I made from being depressed and suicidal to the generally happy person I am now. There was a whole series of decisions and lessons and realizations I've made over a period of several years which probably merits its own post (or series of them). I joined this subreddit a short time ago and have been sort of lurking, trying to understand this community and seeing if I have anything to contribute, and your post makes me realize that maybe just telling my story will help others make their own way on their journey.  To answer your specific question, the one thing I have come to understand is that there really isn't going to be a time when you are entirely done with it. There will always be a chance, however small, that you can fall back into it. However the longer you go without falling back in, the easier it gets. I tend to think of it in terms of black holes and orbital bodies. I'm going to have to create a post on that.  The truths I've found is that recovery and freedom from depression is about breaking habitual negative lines of thought by replacing it with more positive ones. It's about learning how to recognize when you are falling back into the pit of depression, and being able to pull yourself back out. It's about accepting and finding value in yourself, and finding many many reasons to continue to be alive, to contribute and interact with the rest of the world. Coming from the other side, I understand so many things that I used to see as negative really don't have any sort of positive or negative connotation. That was all in my head. Often those negative connotations were put there by others, sometimes inadvertently, sometimes deliberately. I had to learn how to strip those ideas off and choose a new set of ideas to assign. I learned how to identify what kind of ideas were worth keeping and using, and which ones were not and discard them.  I know this doesn't really explain much how I see things now, and how I no longer feel depressed all the time, but I promise to share my story in the hopes of helping you understand how I got where I am, and maybe help you make a similar journey.",0,"I'm not sure if I can fully explain the shift I made from being depressed and suicidal to the generally happy person I am now.

"Is it supposed to be like this?. had depression since I was probably around 14. 38 now and I recall a time when I depressed. Off meds my bouts of deep depression were much sharper it seems. On meds it seems like everything is dulled. Perhaps my age (and the fact that just sick of everyday life in general) that seems to have dulled life experience, maybe the seemingly constant barrage of tragedies and heavy personal baggage, but it seems like my doctors are just barely keeping me functional. It feels like psychological life-support. My question is, is this what meds are supposed to be? Just little bumpers to keep you from falling off the deep end? Do people take meds and actually experience...happiness in their life?

People often ask me why I don't worry about these seemingly huge problems in my life. Well, it's not that I don't worry, because I do. That's just being human, but I constantly remind myself that things usually just work out, and I just need to run the course that I see in front of me.

"Why can't suicide be easy ?. I feel like if suicide was painless and quick, I would have done it a long time ago.","I feel like it's a paradox. People would call you or I selfish, but who are they to assign life or the absence thereof. Many people can't relate to such feelings of loneliness and unworth. But for those who can, being called selfish for suicidal thoughts, makes it all the more confusing of a situation. It also shows you who really cares, cause calling you selfish is just choosing the victim route, for themselves, which is fucked. While some may call it manipulation. Whatever the name, it's hardly sympathetic, and isnt even close to empathetic. Which, empathy, is what this world is lacking. A partnership society would support each other regardless of their stance or tradition. But, we live in a male dominated, monotheistic world. People suck. The only thing we can do is help them.

Does anyone else feel like they get attached to random people?. I'm just curious because for me I just seem to develop a fondness towards anyone who shows me the slightest kindness. I hardly know them if I know them at all and I'm afraid to actually know them since they'll hate me or I'll drag them down.,"Yep. In conversations with my therapist, we have discussed me having some kind of attachment disorder around this. I am constantly seeking and craving connection with others. I can be at an airport and be thinking about connecting with other people. We traced it to childhood stuff (no surprise there) of abandonment and alienation, unmet emotional needs.  Then when and if I do connect, my expectations are pretty high since I am willing to do whatever to reach out to the other person and increase the connection. When that is not reciprocated to the expectations that I have (because they are not trying to fill the massive hole that I am), I feel rejected and then shut down. I internalize this sense as a rejection of me as a person (they don't like me, I'm not worth liking, they got to know and discovered i'm no good). Rinse. Repeat. That's my pattern at least. Knowing the pattern helps, but it doesn't mean I can always identify it and stop it. Thanks for letting me share.",0,"Yep.

I honestly believe learning self-compassion is one of the biggest steps toward healing.","I agree. This is a good reminder. Thank you. I remember realizing that the way I treated myself was much harsher than I would treat anyone else. The best advice that helped me was to talk to myself as I would talk to a loved friend.  I imagine that self compassion applies.

"Depression is like a parasite.. It feeds off my body to live. It lives a life; controlling mine, while I live none.","But also the majority of parasites are not pathogenic and relatively harmless to humans. A parasite such as a tapeworm for example cannot take enough nutrition from a person to drastically physically harm them. How do we get rid of parasites? Medical help is usually necessary - if it is available I would recommend it, I know it may be daunting but it could really help. There are also other options - try and find coping methods that work for you, and there is always support here and someone to talk to; feel free to send me a PM if you ever want. Keep holding on friend.",0,,,

So when I feel that way I loose all hope and give up for that day,"Don't tell yourself that's it's going to be a shitty day. Literally force a smile, beat the thoughts in your head into submission.

I don't Know If This Is Normal Or Not. I always feel like i'm a loser and not worth people's time is that considered a form of depression ?,"not really a form of depression, but it can definitely be a symptom of it. Feeling that you are worthless, a burden, a failure, are all very common to those suffering from depression. What separates it from simply having low self esteem, which many people do, are whether or not you have the other symptoms associated with depression. Things like lack of energy and interest, hopelessness about the future, difficulty sleeping/eating/focusing, suicidal thoughts; experiencing these things on a consistent basis for weeks/months/years is definitely indicative of some sort of depression. Take some time and think about how you feel and been causing it, Do some research into your thoughts and what others say about it. If you decide you need or want help, be afraid to reach out to others and communicate your troubles. I wish you the best of luck, you got this.",0,,,

I feel so misunderstood. Why nobody seems to understand in pain and what going through?

This may seem like useless advice, but it can greatly help if you tell the other people exactly how you're feeling and ask them to try and help you.

"I feel so dysfunctional. Ever wish you could live in someone else's shoes for a day to observe how they function through everyday life?. I feel extremely dysfunctional. I barely have the energy to get through an 8 hour workday. I have no motivation to clean, to be productive, etc.  How do other people do it?

It's just that they have a more hopeful insight, they can fully understand something good will happen from their work, and they can grasp that it's real. That's why I sometimes wonder if Depression is stunted cognition (maybe imagination), because if I could imagine the beauty that life has to offer I'm sure that no matter what got in my way I'd plow through. Why would neurotypicals work so hard if they couldn't in some way see the other side, feel it, almost experiencing it? I just think we're unable to do that.",0,,,

Can you ever be successful?. I'm sure my depression will never go away. When I was 16 I always had high dreams and wanted to be successful.

Why the fuck do I have to succeed?. Why can't I just be human for once.,"You don't.  All my life I've scorned going to college because it held no value for me. I plan to become a traveling hermit and live in the wild with a tent or tarp. I consider myself a successful human being because I've cultivated my mind. I've figured things out. I've matured enough to manage my own personality (as in, not being one of those if you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best people).  Stick with what makes logical sense (you don't need to be successful in the graduating and having a high-paying job sense), not what people will validate, because they won't collectively validate everything that makes sense (namely, the idea in parentheses above: the same idea that you don't need to be successful; most people aren't going to validate that, so fuck them). If it makes logical sense that you don't need to be successful in their bullshit sense, go with that, regardless of whether people will back it up. Logic over worthless people's worthless validation.",0,"All my life I've scorned going to college because it held no value for me.

"I hate the good days. I'm really starting to hate any good days that I may have. I get one every month or so and it's quite possibly worse than just being depressed. It dosent matter how happy I am or how much I try, I know it will be right back. And worse than a normal day. After a few hours I fall right back down.  I honestly don't know why I'm still alive. My life has just been a series of fuck ups. I should be a functioning adult by now and yet I can barely think straight. I'm just running in circles, I do the minimum to survive. Daydreaming is my only escape and even my depression is inhibiting that. Why, why me, why any of us. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.","You got it all wrong. You should be looking forward to making more of those happy days, if you force yourself to be sad simply because you know you're depressed, you'll never get over it ever.  Hang onto those days and strive to make more happy days each month. Depression is fed from negative thought process, let it starve",0,,,

"How do I know how to decide between seeing a therapist or a psychologist or a life coach ?? Please help. I am a 22 year old male, I work 2 part time jobs, I suffer from depression and loneliness and social anxiety and low self esteem, I don't know what to do with my life and what to do with myself. Which category should I seek help from ?","Hi,  I hope you are doing okay today.  If you have never scene anyone, I would recommend a therapist like a LCSW (licensed social worker). In my experience, the type of care you get is less important than the connection you feel with the provider. So I over think it too hard.  Instead, put that energy towards finding the right person. Which means calling lots of places, talking to a lot of people and listening to your gut.  Have a good one",0,"In my experience, the type of care you get is less important than the connection you feel with the provider. So I over think it too hard.

I'm going to a therapist tomorrow. first time. really scared. any advice?,"Don't be afraid, whoever is your therapist has nothing in their mind other than helping you. Make sure to open up to the therapist and tell them how you really feel. This will make finding strategies and solutions much easier for the therapist, and you just might find out a few things about yourself :) Good Luck",0,,,

Fuck. When you try to relate but you'd rather kill yourself.,"hi there, forgive me if I'm wrong with regards to what you are referring to. How I understand your statement is that you try to relate to others but rather do the latter. If this is the case, I want to let you know that even though sometimes you feel you are compelled to relate to other because of societal pressures, you really don't and it depends to what extent. It's important to be who you are and be with people where you can be who you are. But that doesn't mean your depressed you is who you are as a person. Your depression is only a part of who you are, not your defining being. Don't define yourself as 'a depressed person' but more so 'a person that has depression right now at this stage of my life.' Because depression goes away or can be managed very well where it doesn't intrude on your life in a daily or constant basis. You are much more than your depression. Try to take smell steps that you are comfortable with and learn some coping strategies in managing depressed feelings. Ideally it'll be great if you can see a therapist but I understand that has it's own restrains. The key thing is to never give up on yourself because when you believe, there will be a way out of this. I always tell others that healing isn't easy but it's worth it because you are worth it, whether you feel it right now or not.",0,,,

"Do any of you guys feel like me?. For some background, I'm 18 and in my freshman year of university.  For a couple months now I've just been feeling sorta weird. It's like a long funk. I don't know how to describe it. If I had to choose, I'd say I feel empty or indifferent. I'm still able to laugh and find things funny, but a lot of the time I just feel like a machine, doing things because I have to. My motivation is minimal. A part of me is just not transitioning very well from high school to university. I don't like it here and I don't know how to describe it, either. Maybe out of place? Not fitting in? The environment here is just cold. I've been looking forward to sleeping more lately, but I dunno if that's just my exhaustion from late night studying/work or something else. I think I failed my chemistry exam and the course and it doesn't really phase me. I don't know what's wrong. Am I depressed? Do you guys feel similarly?","Sounds like apathy to me. I'm guessing you feel kind of lost and without a direction and you just are following the path that you feel is required of you. While apathy is one symptom of depression, it doesn't necessarily mean that you have depression. By no means am I downplaying depression or trying to convince you that nothing is wrong because there isn't any on true definition of depression. I felt like you for a while, just a few small pleasures but nothing really else. For me, it went away after a few months. If you want to talk about it more or anything, feel free to ask anything. My only advice is don't give up now, because if it goes away, you'll regret a lot of things that you stopped caring about.",0,"I felt like you for a while, just a few small pleasures but nothing really else.

"They should just hurry up and make a pill that forfeits the hunger for love and companionship.. It would be surrender- letting the shadows of doubt win, but you care. You would finally perceive your world as happy again as you independently went through your life, alone without care. Couples in public would be mere puzzles that you care to solve rather than reminders of failure and what could never be yours.
