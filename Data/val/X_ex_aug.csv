Mental Health support. Mom says try harder. A doctor prescribes me pills. A councillor gives me kindergarten-level reading material and handouts. The internet gives me a phone number. Friends give me absence. The psychiatric ward gives me a doctor. But repeat after me... I have mental health support.,"Oh I know. In my opinion the true reason that you, me and about 90% of people with depression feels the way you portrayed in this post is because out of all those people who are support. no one really understands on a deep, emotional, and philosophical level how this disorder ruins your life and makes it miserably painful. The ONLY way you know is if you have experienced it yourself. Once you get truly depressed you enter the void. Some people are only in that void for some brief time, while clinically depressed people like ourselves live in this void. That support group doesn't speak our language. That's the fucking problem. They don't know the void. They can only read about the void, but they don't live in it. The support group approaches depression in the same way that males know what it's like to go through childbirth (no this is not a political push either way). It's just stating, THEY DONT but they can read all about it and try to imagine the pain, but they can never truly feel it.

"First time using anti depressant pills and feel really energized, hyped and my whole body is shaking is this normal?. I use 100 mg Sertalin and I am 17 yo","Yup. In my experience sertraline was more intense than (es)citalopram the first few days and I started slow at like 12.5mg.  It's really the first week - actually about the first 4 days - effect. The thing that requires the black box warning because it's a surprise if no one tells you to expect it (and not everyone gets it so powerfully).  If it's too intense talk to your doctor about cutting back and moving up slower (I've settled on 50mg and that was after titrating up). Try splitting it up into at least two doses so it doesn't all hit you at once - sertraline's got a relatively short serum life and I'm preferring a morning and afternoon dose.  ... and during this 'jittery' period try to take it at least 4 hours before bed so you'll have a shot at getting some proper sleep.  It gets a *lot* more boring (but still potentially helpful) once your body adapts! Right now all sorts of stuff is going on with your serotonin and it's pretty much the 'psychedelic' part. Once your system adjusts the idea is that the drug is holding a 'buffer' of serotonin in the synapses so it's there when you need it for more even moods and less discomfort, but until that settles down it can be pretty trippy and stimulating (especially with sertraline that has a nice extra dopamine stimulatory effect, which is pretty helpful offsetting some of the more annoying SSRI side effects in the longer term).  So if you feel like you're going to jump out of your skin now - yeah, that's normal, and it passes in about those 4-7 days (for me, anyway). Also heads-up that.. yeah, with sertraline, those days included a lot of nausea and (ahem) intense GI effects for me too - that passes too.",0,,,

What is it like to seek help as a minor. 14 years old and am depressed and have issues with anxiety and self harm. If i tried to seek help with a doctor what process would I go through and what would most likely happen. in the U.S. if it makes a difference,"it *probably* depends on the state (edit: what state in the US). being 14, you are going to be tethered to your parent/guardian legally. the therapist/counselor/psychologist will be legally required to tell your guardians of anything that serves of specific risk. for example, i told my therapist that i was suicidal and he had to contact my mother and explain the basics of the situation. for self harm, im not sure exactly how/if the information would be disclosed by the therapist/counselor/psychologist to your parents.. but im assuming if you are physically hurting yourself to a GREAT EXTENT then yes, it would most likely be disclosed.  im 18 now, and started seeing my on-campus(university) therapist and psychiatrist at the beginning of the school year, where i was 17. it sucks not being in control of your life, but what can you do, you know?  if getting to see a therapist is an issue, i would recommend asking to talk to your doctor/pediatrician in private (during a normal check-up) and say tht youve had symptoms of depression/anxiety and you'd like to have some help talking to your parent about getting help. if it's not an issue of talking to your parent/guardian, then what's the worry? if you cant see a doctor, a school counselor could help you have this conversation with your parent! or even a supportive teacher that you trust.  i went through a very similar situation when i was younger, and very much regret not being more persistent about getting help when i needed it. it mght not go away, and with school only getting harder and more stressful as you age, it's *really hard* to deal with all this emotional baggage. everyone deserves to feel the best that they can.  you dont want to suffer anymore and someday you wont! feel free to pm me, i'd be happy to be your pen-pal through all this &lt;3",0,,,

Do you also think your depression is due to the fact that we live in a sick society?. ...and that you wouldn't be as depressed \(or depressed at all\) if you had lived in a different time period?,"I just can't stand the social media shit.  I was really messed up as a kid, chemical imbalance at birth, obese until I was 22, put on antipsychotics around 13. Stupidly stopped taking them and I just got more and more detached from reality. Combined with my very mild ASD I never really got to have much interaction with other kids outside of school, never even really had friends I would talk to during the day. I never learned how to be an adult when it comes to relationships (of all kinds). Because society just developed that way, I guess. Everybody is on their damn phones. God forbid you want to ... *gasp* ... walk up and say hi to someone on the street.  I went to university last year and it was a bit better, and liberating, but I still had big trouble connecting with anyone. I made one good friend (my roommate) and met a couple people on Tinder, I tried to go to school clubs and be proactive and not feel sorry for myself. But I just can't connect with anyone unless they are literally forced to be in a room with me, apparently. When I go back I will try to smile more. That's what everyone keeps telling me.  To answer your question, I don't think I am depressed because of how we live. I'm depressed because of what essentially amounts to bad luck. But it sure as hell makes my life a lot harder. At the same time, we are lucky to live the comfortable lives we do nowadays. If I had been born in another time, who can say if I would even be alive right now?",0,,,

Adults have the same issues with heartbreak and money trouble as teens, the only difference is they think they're experienced. No one is experienced. Everything that happens to you is the first time that unique situation happened to your unique person. Your reaction is the only thing that changes how these events affect you.

How could I be happy if nobody is happy with me?. And why would I want to live on?,"Hi there, you know that is a very good question and I used to have similar thoughts as you. I now have a question to ask you, why would other be happy with you when you are not happy with yourself? The thing is, we need to develop self love and self care first. Because without it, we will be too dependent on others and that becomes burdensome because no one's life is perfect and they all have their own issues to deal with. Even though other people wants to love you and support you, they can only do it to a certain extent. The rest of the void that you have inside of you can only be filled by yourself. I know you don't feel it but being able to learn to self love is the key to happiness because that is when you feel like your life is in your control again, not on others.

Of course, depression does not make it easier, that is a fact. Do you have someone with whom you can talk to? For example, having a really deep conversation, tell them about their biggest fears? Where do not have to pretend to be happy? Using a mask is exhausting like hell, and the more you try to keep it, the more explosive it will be, when you cannot hold it anymore. In that sense, I speak from experience. And finally, but not least, it is completely good not to feel happy sometimes. You just have to feel sad, outside the circuit, careless, rejected or even hated sometimes. Those are the moments in which you really analyze yourself and your actions, (something you must keep under control, because too much of that is destructive), and if you hug him, he rolls with him, telling yourself that this is natural And just a response of something within you, you really can't identify yet, those times could end up being beneficial to you.

What separates it from simply having low self esteem, which many people do, are whether or not you have the other symptoms associated with depression. Things like lack of energy and interest, hopelessness about the future, difficulty sleeping/eating/focusing, suicidal thoughts; experiencing these things on a consistent basis for weeks/months/years is definitely indicative of some sort of depression.
