1,0,Same. I used to go to a psychiatrist through my university but since I graduated havent been to see one. It's been 7 months and I have an appointment in August with a new dr. but I'll need to do something by Monday because tomorrow is my last dose of bupropion. These last couple of months have been awful. I have no motivation to do anything which is why I'm out of medication. I've procrastinated and it sucks. When I was seeing the dr. I would actually be happy. Like have moments where I just feel at peace and truly happy. I miss the fuck out of those moments. At least before I didn't know what I was missing.|,Same.

Hope that helps","I just tell myself it will pay off in the future and thus far that has helped. I have had 2 shitty jobs in the past and every day I just told myself to suck it up and one day I will have a job I love. I, like you, had trouble finding replacement jobs, hell I never even heard back 90% of the time. I gave up for a while then one night I was so pissed at my job I went on Craigslist, searched one more time for the job I wanted, applied to a company and got the job and it has been the best job I have ever had. Hope that helps"
