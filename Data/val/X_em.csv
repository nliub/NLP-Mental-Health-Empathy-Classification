.... Is it ok for feel sorry for my self,"Life is not what happens to you - it's how you react to it. If you feel sorry for yourself, and most depressed people do, it's because they decide that there is a payoff in doing it.

You can give up and never try again, or you can take that feeling and extend it into the future: - Imagine feeling this way, and doing nothing about it, for a year. 5 years. 10 years. What has your life become? - Now imagine what your life would be like if you forced yourself to get of bed, brush your teeth, went to the store or coffee shop, talked to someone, helped someone, every day.

Is anyone else incredibly funny irl but miserable af when they get home?. What kind of jokes do you do? Who knows what you really feel inside? Why do we rely on other people's happiness?,"It's fucking weird. I often have to bring every ounce of willpower up to bring myself to go to a party with frends, even though I know it will be good. But once I'm there, I'm often the Life of the Party, or so I think. I had people coming up to me, greeting me by my name and telling me how much fun they had last time we had met each other. Which was a year ago. For the first and last time since. I barely remembered their faces and not a single name. So I guess I left an impression. I really like to banter, to do play on words and take words from their mouth and turn them around in a fun way. I joke and tell stories with expressive facial expressions and big gestures. I'm sarcastic, sometimes even cynical. And I joke a lot about myself, mostly in a non-flattering way. I think people like me in general, I seldomly had someone outright refuse to interact with me. But on the other hand, as soon as I come home, I feel a crushing void and I feel alone and that everything is pointless. Those feelings remain in my day-to-day life. And it starts to interfere with my work, for example. I am not one to contain my feelings in an enviroment where I spend most of my days and life in. My boss already told me once, in a pretty long phase of being really depressed, that even my collegues said that something must be seriously wrong and the have no fun working around and with me if I'm in such mood. I can be fun at work, too. I made my co-workers laugh on a lot f different occasions. But that happens in good phases. But there are very bad phases where I, at best, don't say a single word all day unless absolutly necessary and at worst, I am filled with rage the whole day and can't contain it. Last week I was as close to quitting my job as I was never before. Maybe it would be best for all.  Whatever, long story short: I think I can be really funny, too. Despite the fact I feel fucking miserable inside or do not feel anything at all.",0,,,

If I couldn't remember to brush my teeth every day (and I really kept trying) how would I remember to do anything else? How would I remember to learn, be good at school, how would I remember to do all the other things I kept forgetting? How could I be anything more than terrible, like I seemed to keep being. Even when I succeeded why did I always feel like I was so useless and bad at everything the moment I didn't? Why did it seem to keep getting worse?

"People often say depression is emotional numbness, but I find it's more accurate for me to call it emotional constipation.. It's crude, I know, but really quite accurate. I find that my emotions build up, but there's never an outlet, and the more pressure I put or the more emotionally affected I should be, the harder it is to have any emotional output. It continues until something frees up and becomes loose - usually something small that slips through the cracks. At that point, the floodgates open - I get freed up to feel more strongly, usually with explosive effects. By contrast, less depressive days are the days where I'm emotionally loose enough to function - my feeling machine has been well oiled.",Seems accurate.

Currently on Lexapro sub and going to be prescribed Wellbutrin. Anyone been on this combo before?. I am currently taking Lexapro once a day and my doc just prescribed me Wellbutrin. I was just wondering if anyone has ever been on this combo before. I am currently on Lexapro for Depression and Anxiety. My depression is becoming less manageable the longer I am on Lexapro. I am also tired all of the time. I am scared to try any other SSRI's as they have really messed with my libido in the past.

Just wanted to come here and see if anyone has taken both and what your experience was ?,"I was on Lexapro and Wellbutrin for the longest time and didn't have any bad side effects, but it definitely didn't help me as much as I'd hoped.

Im so fucking tired of being alone. Why is love so complicated,"Life is like a wave. There are ups and downs. One day, no matter how hard been, your life will get better again. But until then, see all the bad stuff that is going on in your life as because in reality, there is no such thing as or You define if it is. Try to find the postive part in your current situation. There is always a reason, why some things happen. The reason is, to teach you a lesson. For example: if you have no friends (like me), see it as negative. Try to find the lesson behind this experience. In this case, life wants to tell you, that loneliness is not what you, in your deepest self, want. You need persons such as friends around you. Take a desicion now, that you want to be lonely anymore, and life will listen to you and bring you friends again, and if it work, try to know, why it (i know the answer, but a bit complicated (msg me if you want to know)) and what the lesson in this experience is. Also: Life is like a mirror. If you feel lonely inside, the outside world will deliver you that loneliness. pretty simple. So if you want to be lonely anymore, try not to feel lonely (i know fking hard, but you can reach that with more knowledge about the truth (msg me if you want to know more). If you feel lonely inside, that means, that the outside world will automaticlly deliver you NOT-loneliness, which means new persons will enter your life.  Oh also: Life is a paradox. right with love being complicated, but at the same time, the easiest thing you could possibly imagine. If you understand something, just reply :)",0,,,

I love you.. I may not know you personally but I want to say I love you. I almost committed suicide this last year.

"Advice on how to date a depressed person?. I am in love with my boyfriend for him. Unfortunately, he has battled depression long before me. I love him, but loving him can be so hard. It hurts when he becomes distant when his emotions become overwhelming. It hurts when he becomes upset. I know he is going through an extremely tough mental battle, so I refrain from telling him my thoughts. I have got him to seek help (antidepressants). He has begun opening up to his friends and family. I am very happy for him! I am proud of how far he has progressed. He loves me a lot, and depends on me for his hapiness. It is difficult making him happy when his depression is taking a toll on me. I have sacrificed so much of my hapiness for him, and all in the name of love. Right now, he is spending time with his friends and BEING HAPPY while I am at home worrying about him and thinking of ways in which I can be a better girlfriend. I am choosing to prioritize his emotions over mine because he is a good person who deserves to happy. Any advice on dating a depressed person?","Dating a depressed person is like dating a child with temper tantrums. I suggest you to focus on your own happiness first, then be there to support them when they need you. You are ultimately two individuals with individual needs and ideals. Live and let live, support and be supported are the key. You are at this point just dating and you must remember that you shouldn't give more than what you must. It should be a harmony where equal emotional exchange is the mandate. Otherwise it takes a toll lime it is right now and if things go sour it will be your fault and you are bound to hurt the most because you gave more than you had and got lesser in return.

Just cut myself for the first time. I've been drinking and i don't know how I feel,"Ok, how deeply did you cut yourself and with what? If it is bleeding a lot, clean it up, run it under water, don't let the blood dry and go nasty. Pat it dry. Bandage it up, if you can. Also if you have some antiseptic cream, use some of that on it.

"Has anyone here gotten better and stayed better?. As far as I've been able to tell, no matter if you get better or not, depression will always just come back. Temporary problem, my ass.","This stuff all exists on a spectrum, so maybe arriving at some place of being totally better is not what it seems. I've had hardcore depression for many years, but I have definitely moved the bar significantly (without meds and without getting what i want in life or something, like a great relationship) which I can confirm especially in the moments when my external circumstances are going terribly, but i dont fall into 6 months of suicidal morbidity. I see depression (speaking only for myself here) as a product of thoughts and meanings. The same thing can happen to two people, and a depressed person will give it an incredibly dark meaning, whereas a non depressed person might give it a neutral or positive one. To me, growth out of depression is when you are finally grasping the arbitrary nature of meaning, and the impersonal nature of thought, and can start to make conscious rather than automatic decisions about what kind of meanings and thoughts you feed and go with (even arbitrarily). So, I arbitrarily decide to look at failing as good, because it gives me good reference experiences, rather than as evidence that i am worthless. Things like that. I still struggle a lot, but there is overwhelming evidence that you can slowly climb out of the hole with very hard inner work, and that the things that would have previously sent you down the spiral become more like non issues. Meditation is the single most powerful tool i've found.",0,,,

You don't have to like your body at this point, just accept that it is yours. I just try to accept the intrusive thoughts for what they are: intrusive thoughts. They're intruding.

The ONLY way you know is if you have experienced it yourself. Once you get truly depressed you enter the void.

I feel worthless. My gf cheated on me twice. I feel worthless. It has destroyed my self-esteem.,"Sorry to hear that. Obviously a very painful experience. Of course you're not crazy for feeling like that makes you wonder about your value as a person, but to get through this life you'll really want to get to the place where you understand other people's behaviors are a reflection of them and not of you. I'm not trying to suggest some stupid mind-trick here, of course when someone chooses another person over you, you are going to have thoughts of worthlessness and insecurity. But even if someone you are with realizes they'd rather be with someone else, it doesn't require them to cheat on you, they could just be an adult and end a relationship before doing something behind someone's back. Human love is fickle. There's no way to ever say that anyone who decides to spend time with you owes it to you to honor that choice forever, but it certainly doesn't mean they have to cheat and lie. This advice has stuck with me ever since I heard it on a podcast; don't ever expect other human beings to be rational, or to assume they are playing by the same set of rules and understandings as you are. They lived so much of their lives before you were ever it in, you have no idea if this behavior could be a reflection of something somebody else did to them in their past or whatever. You can't blame yourself for other people. Otherwise a total stranger could walk up to you on the street and punch you, and you'll spend the next week wondering what you did wrong instead of identifying that person as a violent crazy person. Regardless, it isn't exactly the most logical part of your mind that is going to feel rotten about this for a while, so no amount of information is going to make it feel better right away. But try to love yourself, and work on coming around to that understanding that other people's choices do not say anything about you, only about them. This action means that they are a cheater, not that you are worthless.",0,"Sorry to hear that.

How did you (If you did) beat depression?. I'm curious to know how y'all did it.,"I was diagnosed with moderate to severe depression while in undergrad.

There are times though that I can feel the dark clouds approaching but they're much easier to handle, and the lows are more evened out to what I guess would be considered a normal level.",0,,,

I feel like I'm so depressed that it's hard to even pretend to be happy. Does anyone else feel this way?,"Pretending to be happy can be extremely hard, no matter if depressed or not. Sure, depression doesn't make it any easier, thats a fact. Do you have someone you can talk to? For example have a really deep conversation, tell them about your biggest fears? Where you dont have to pretend to be happy? Wearing a mask is exhausting as hell, and the longer you try to keep it up, the more explosive will it be, when you can't hold it up any longer. In that regard, I speak from experience. And last but not least, it's completely fine to not feel happy sometimes. You just have to feel sad, out of the loop, neglected, rejected or even hated sometimes. Those are the moments where you really analyze yourself and your doings, (something you should keep under control, because too much of it is destructive), and if you embrace it, roll with it, telling yourself that this is natural and just a response of something inside you, you can't really pinpoint yet, those times could actually end up being beneficial for you. Noone feels 100% happy all the time, and if so, I'd call them liars. If you want, shoot me a pm, anytime!

"What's the point?. Why am I supposed to stay alive? I don't want to reproduce and I don't care for anyone in my life. I don't see a point, especially if I'm just going to die in the end.","It's a sad reality that everything comes to an end and that we're not given an exact explanation of why we're here or what the meaning of it all is. The way I see it is that we're here to give our life meaning one way or another. Since we don't know the meaning we have to make the meaning. Some people find that through their work, family, helping others, etc. Life is full of endless possibilities of what we can do with it. It's hard getting to the point where we feel like we're happy or accomplished but that in itself is another aspect of life and finding meaning. For some people it could take most of their lives to find the meaning that they were looking for and in my view I'd rather spend my whole life looking for that meaning and helping who I can along the way than to just accept that there's no meaning to it and end it since that's not really an answer. I may never get the answer myself but I can at least enjoy the journey leading to the end and maybe that in and of itself was the meaning all along. You'll meet many varieties of people throughout your life who will give you different perspectives of what meaning is to them and maybe that will help you on your journey and maybe it won't. We have the time we're given and what we do with it is dependent on us. Even after we die and join the rest of the universe in it's infinite there'll still be people around who will say, Hey remember u/OkayScience, I want to do what he did and live my life to its fullest. We can still be remembered for the life we lived even after we're gone and in that way we'll essentially live forever. This is the way I see life and it helps me from time to time.

"Do you think some jobs are really meant for people with mental illnesses?. I mean to say that those jobs are only limited to people with depression, just that a good fit Edit: Jobs like being an artist, working in the film industry, therapists, nurses, etc.","Every job you mentioned will have significant pressure, which can lead to more depression. Artist - a friend of mine is a indie musician type of artist. Born in a rich family, great social support with what she does, good education. She accepts that being an artist doesn't bring good money because interest and passion matter more. Still has been clinically depressed for years. Still making meager money. Every person I can think I'd back in college that studied fine arts or art history has rich families so they can continue to pursue a masters or phd in areas they like without worries. For those who don't have a privileged background, starving artists are no cliche - that's the norm. And I think people who are already depressed are unlikely to find poverty to be a good escape. Film - very unstable depending what you work on. Networking is extremely important and you must be socially savvy because it's all about power and money, even in independent films. This means competition and getting funding will be incredibly difficult. Therapists - you need good education and superb social skills and emotional control. A depressed person is unlikely to have the latter. All require years of training. Nurses - I don't need to elaborate more. Just google how many perfectly healthy, capable, and motivated nurses who still got burnt out and depressed. It's long work hours, high pressure and physically demanding to boot. What I want to say is this: any profession will have major shortcoming and sacrifices. There's no such thing as profession that are suitable for depressed people. Any job can turn a healthy person depressed - on the contrary, any depressed person can find recovery by engaging in other professions and become successful.",0,,,

Can someone who has been through depression describe what it is like to be done with it?. I just want to know what awaits us one day.,"I saw your post several hours ago and I've been thinking all afternoon about what you asked. I'm not sure if I can fully explain the shift I made from being depressed and suicidal to the generally happy person I am now. There was a whole series of decisions and lessons and realizations I've made over a period of several years which probably merits its own post (or series of them). I joined this a short time ago and have been sort of lurking, trying to understand this community and seeing if I have anything to contribute, and your post makes me realize that maybe just telling my story will help others make their own way on their journey. To answer your specific question, the one thing I have come to understand is that there really isn't going to be a time when you are entirely done with it. There will always be a chance, however small, that you can fall back into it. However the longer you go without falling back in, the easier it gets. I tend to think of it in terms of black holes and orbital bodies. I'm going to have to create a post on that. The truths I've found is that recovery and freedom from depression is about breaking habitual negative lines of thought by replacing it with more positive ones. It's about learning how to recognize when you are falling back into the pit of depression, and being able to pull yourself back out. It's about accepting and finding value in yourself, and finding many many reasons to continue to be alive, to contribute and interact with the rest of the world. Coming from the other side, I understand so many things that I used to see as negative really don't have any sort of positive or negative connotation. That was all in my head. Often those negative connotations were put there by others, sometimes inadvertently, sometimes deliberately. I had to learn how to strip those ideas off and choose a new set of ideas to assign. I learned how to identify what kind of ideas were worth keeping and using, and which ones were not and discard them. I know this doesn't really explain much how I see things now, and how I no longer feel depressed all the time, but I promise to share my story in the hopes of helping you understand how I got where I am, and maybe help you make a similar journey.",0,,,

Sometimes I make myself go do something outside of the house to distract myself, even if it's not actually enjoyable. This combo sucks, and I hope you find a way to lessen or even break the pattern.",0,"This combo sucks, and I hope you find a way to lessen or even break the pattern.|","This combo sucks, and I hope you find a way to lessen or even break the pattern.","This combo sucks, and I hope you find a way to lessen or even break the pattern."

jobs. does anyone here know any way a freshman can get a job in california. im just hoping that getting a job and earning a little bit of money will help my depression to calm down or not be as severe.,"Freshman in high school or college? If HS, you can get a work permit at 15 I think. You're supposed to have one as long as you're working and under 18. As for finding one at that age most people I know went into food or retail. Coffee shops, fast food, some with cars did pizza delivery. Theaters usually higher younger people. They're simple jobs that don't require a lot of training and younger employees help keep younger crowds coming in. There should be someone at your school like a counselor with info on work permits. Edit: its also great that you want to work. Having the money can give you more breathing room with bills and you can start building some retirement money. Plus having the experience will help get better jobs. Just remember you don't have to save everything. If all you do is work and your money goes right back out to food/bills/rent/etc, work will become a burden. Put aside a little bit each paycheck as a whatever fund. It wont be much at first but after a few months you'll have a good bit of change set aside. Wanna go for a weekend getaway? Do it. Looking for a new TV. Buy it. I usually set aside $100 month and typically buy something I'd wanted after a few months but couldn't normally justify. Worked out well. I still had some other money to go out to eat or do things, but I got a big reward every few months.",0,,,
"Does anyone else turn the TV on when you're alone, just to hear someone else's voice?. I'm trying to hide from the lonliness.","I don't really use the tv, but I do usually have a youtube video playing on the background when I'm by the computer. I could be browsing random websites or trying to do some crafting etc, but I need the distraction of the videos. Also if I'm watching a movie or tv show I often have to do something else at the same time - solitaire, browse a magazine, read an article. I know I can concentrate just on one thing at a time, but there's something about too much quiet bringing bad thoughts to the surface.",0,,,

"Depression and capitalism. Does anyone else feel the way we have set up our western societies has helped trigger depression?

Got sick of it, can't stomach shelling out $700+ a month when I earn $8 an hour just for a shitty apartment I'll never have time to spend in because I'm worried about making the rent for it. It's depressing and monotonous. I'm personally building a van to live out of right now, I plan to leave in the summer. I think of you have any itch to get out there and do something that makes you feel whole you should do it. I've dealt with depression long enough and frankly I'm sick of it, so I'm trying something a little new. Travel, fresh people, fresh scenes, fresh work. It won't be the most luxurious life but it'll probably provide more than the norm of working all day every day.",0,,,
Do you also think your depression is due to the fact that we live in a sick society?. ...and that you wouldn't be as depressed \(or depressed at all\) if you had lived in a different time period?,"I just can't stand the social media shit. I was really messed up as a kid, chemical imbalance at birth, obese until I was 22, put on antipsychotics around 13. Stupidly stopped taking them and I just got more and more detached from reality. Combined with my very mild ASD I never really got to have much interaction with other kids outside of school, never even really had friends I would talk to during the day. I never learned how to be an adult when it comes to relationships (of all kinds). Because society just developed that way, I guess. Everybody is on their damn phones. God forbid you want to ... *gasp* ... walk up and say hi to someone on the street. I went to university last year and it was a bit better, and liberating, but I still had big trouble connecting with anyone. I made one good friend (my roommate) and met a couple people on Tinder, I tried to go to school clubs and be proactive and not feel sorry for myself. But I just can't connect with anyone unless they are literally forced to be in a room with me, apparently. When I go back I will try to smile more. That's what everyone keeps telling me. To answer your question, I don't think I am depressed because of how we live. I'm depressed because of what essentially amounts to bad luck. But it sure as hell makes my life a lot harder. At the same time, we are lucky to live the comfortable lives we do nowadays. If I had been born in another time, who can say if I would even be alive right now?",0,,,

But I've seen people around me and it's just a blend of being tired, in pain, and or being slow, clumsy, close to handicap doing basic things.

Sorry if this is triggering anything in anyone, or a bit despairing.
