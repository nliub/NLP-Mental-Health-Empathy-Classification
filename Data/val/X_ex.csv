I would say that MAYBE, if I gave advice on it, it would be that I used to have a similar thing with shyness, and with that I pushed myself into more and more social situations and now am not so shy. It MAYBE might work the same way with liking/disliking social interaction. But I do that everyday and I still don't like people. I'm more COMFORTABLE around them, but I still don't LIKE them. And it's an entirely different ball park with depression/anxiety than shyness, otherwise if it were so easy to just 'force' yourself to socialize to fix the problem, I'd be doing it myself.

What is it like to seek help as a minor. 14 years old and am depressed and have issues with anxiety and self harm. If i tried to seek help with a doctor what process would I go through and what would most likely happen. in the U.S. if it makes a difference,"it *probably* depends on the state (edit: what state in the US). being 14, you are going to be tethered to your parent/guardian legally. the therapist/counselor/psychologist will be legally required to tell your guardians of anything that serves of specific risk. for example, i told my therapist that i was suicidal and he had to contact my mother and explain the basics of the situation. for self harm, im not sure exactly how/if the information would be disclosed by the therapist/counselor/psychologist to your parents.. but im assuming if you are physically hurting yourself to a GREAT EXTENT then yes, it would most likely be disclosed.  im 18 now, and started seeing my on-campus(university) therapist and psychiatrist at the beginning of the school year, where i was 17. it sucks not being in control of your life, but what can you do, you know?  if getting to see a therapist is an issue, i would recommend asking to talk to your doctor/pediatrician in private (during a normal check-up) and say tht youve had symptoms of depression/anxiety and you'd like to have some help talking to your parent about getting help. if it's not an issue of talking to your parent/guardian, then what's the worry? if you cant see a doctor, a school counselor could help you have this conversation with your parent! or even a supportive teacher that you trust.  i went through a very similar situation when i was younger, and very much regret not being more persistent about getting help when i needed it. it mght not go away, and with school only getting harder and more stressful as you age, it's *really hard* to deal with all this emotional baggage. everyone deserves to feel the best that they can.  you dont want to suffer anymore and someday you wont! feel free to pm me, i'd be happy to be your pen-pal through all this &lt;3",0,,,

"Sometimes I wonder if I really even have depression. I was diagnosed 2 or 3 years ago by my family doctor, who prescribed SSRIs \(which I never took\). My moods range from suicidal and self harming to just feeling out of sorts and not at peace with myself. Sometimes I go months without feeling like that, sometimes it seems to come about every few weeks and lasts for weeks at a time.  I don't know, I sometimes compare myself to my boyfriend who has a team of psychologists and psychiatrists working to diagnose him, whereas I just went to my family doctor, filled in a questionnaire, and boom got labelled with depression. I wonder if I'm faking it or blowing my feelings out of proportion, especially comparing it to more serious cases of mental illness.  Does anyone else ever feel this way? How do you deal with it?","Just because you don't or can't have access to that level of mental health care does not mean your own mental illness is any less valid.  I have always had a team, a prescribing doctor, therapist, and GP. Sometimes specifically a team that works together, sometimes just doctor's that kind of share notes but don't ever meet up. I am very lucky. Very few people get this level of treatment. Any number of genuine suicidal thoughts is too many. Everyone gets depressed, but when you stay there long enough to consider life actually painful to live you have depression. It can be really hard not to play mental illness Olympics.

Or also the pressure of feeling others' expectations of you on your shoulders.  I still haven't worked things out that I'm able to effectively handle failure myself, but mainly people can feel better when they fail, because they recognise it as a learning experience, or it is an inevitable part of the process.

I am living, but not alive -- there is a difference; I'm trying to find completion for that void.  I try to accept myself and my flaws -- even some of the current ones i want gone as i progress towards that. I still fight myself over that and/or other things at times. But i still try to accept and understand.  I just keep going. For the sake of something i still believe in somewhere out there that might be befitting of me, as i want it. If it's there, i must get to it -- i must have it. At the same time, i must better myself until i am who and what I've always wanted to be, both in and out.  The sense of failure and futility are always there -- i just keep trying to keep them level and not overwhelm me. I try to do things for myself i thought i had from others. Things i would truly want done to me by others. But there's nobody. I got used to it. Despite still wanting the opposite in my own humble way. I just think of what who might actually still exist out there, think and feel if i weren't doing this, willingly, to keep pushing.  I keep trying to believe that regardless, i deserve things my way. After everything especially. That it can't all be for naught. I've yet to see that. That's why I'm still going for the future. Even if its path got shattered long-ago, many-a-time.  I hope this helps.",0,,,
"I had to drag myself out of bed, then I cut myself. For the first time in a month","Hi, I just relapsed too. You're so much stronger than you think--I haven't been able to beat a month since November but maybe I will now that I'm back to seeing a therapist again.

"The dilemma I'm facing every day. Don't be sad and quiet, people don't like sad and quiet.  Don't pretend to be happy and cheerful, people can feel you are pretending, and they don't like disingenuity.","But then it can be even worse.. If we honestly, truly act like we feel 100% of the time, there really isn't much hope to establish any real connection to anyone.. It's really fucking difficult to wear a mask all the time, but at least it's marginally better that being alone all the time, isn't it? Most people don't want to associate with someone who is severely depressed and deathly anxious, and I can't even blame them.. If I do act like how I feel, I'm probably a nightmare to be around, because there's an aura of sadness and hopelessness that surrounds me. How can I expect anyone to approach me? Even if there is someone who does, it would be crazy to expect them to completely accept a miserable wreck like me. I mean, I can't just take and not give.. And then there's the people who act all smug and give you all that fucking moronic rose-tinted glasses shit with an air of superiority, a la /r/wowthanksimcured, and you feel even worse. It does feel like shit, but I've managed to construct separate personalities for interacting with my family and for anything job-related, because at a workplace, nobody gives a fuck if you're rotting on the inside due to over a decade of depression, anxiety, and self-hatred. So, while I wish I could agree with what you say, it's just not applicable..",0,,,

"Do you know EXACTLY what you need to do to feel better, but it's just so damn hard?. I thought long and hard today and... I guess I always kinda knew the bits and pieces of problems I have, but I pieced them all together today.  My depression started because I was isolated during a school semester (plus hammered with various stress, family and medical). And so.. my self esteem dropped. When I was able to get home, I still felt isolated because being away at school for so long... it felt like I didn't have the same interests as my friends at home anymore. My self esteem continued to drop. I separated from my toxic family, and felt a lot of loss. So... about now, my self esteem is rock bottom. Now it's hard to find connections with people, because I fall into cycles of feeling so negatively about myself. Like a hole I don't have the strength to pull myself out of. I just wish I had someone who could throw me a line, and work with me for a little while until I can get back on my feet! But.. I'm alone. What can I do KNOWING this, but being unable to act on it?
