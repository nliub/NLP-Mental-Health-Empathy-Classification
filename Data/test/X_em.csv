I know I can't claim to be an expert after reading just one textbook, but even an idiot can realize that your behavior and who you are is just totally as a result of your parents. The genetic aspects aren't their fault of course, but they are perfect human specimens, so you can imagine what 17 years of always being wrong has done to my self esteem and thought process. Strangely, being cognizant of that fact doesn't change it much. Of course, I've directly told my parents I blame them for who I am, and as perfect specimens, they told me that I can't keep blaming them for everything. There's truth to that of course, but it's rather incredible that they can find the gall to abdicate themselves of all guilt and responsibility. I'd better just get on my hands and knees and obey their every whim, since they're the ones who work and pay for my existence, regardless of whether or not I can actually do jack shit about that (child labor laws, yo).

"I never asked to be alive, so why do I have to stay alive?. It wasn't my decision to come into this world. If no one wants me here than why do I have to work this hard to be here?","Youa re comdemned to a life of freedom. Is an old quote i tihnk its from satre, but im not sure. And later there has been others who disagree. You are forced to become alive and aware that much is for sure. Unlike most animals you are a creature born with the abillity gather information and draw conclusion not jsut based on your senses, and that oftens leads to the question. Why am i alive? Not only that, you are forced into not just a world, but a particular part of the word, which then in turn will teach you values and conformaty, and for some people this works out well. If you can find it in yourself to look at the context you have born into and be satisfied with it, enjoy it and love it, if you can find shelter, food, sleep, joy, love and challenge in you enviroment. But for some of us, we don't fin those things, we suddenly find ourself in a enviroment that conflicts with our nature, the context of our existence is not operationable with the essence of our nature. You first statement i cannot, say is wrong, you didn't decide to exist, but netiher did you chose not to. And existing in of itself is not evil or good. But if the context of your life is making your life or nature feel haunted and painful. Then a there are options available. The first thing, no matter how you want to change your context for the better, rquires that you step back and see the context. Where are you from, what values have been impsoed on you, which makes sense to you which doesn't, how has these values been imposed, who has impsoed them. For these purposes your reasoning is a great tool. It easy to finda figure head or a single person to blame, but you really have to map it out, and see udnerstand ana analyse your einvirotment and the people in it, and then find the conflicts with your nature, the pain and sadness. Then you have to figure out a plan. And this is a tremendous task, not just do you have to think thoguhts you ahve not been taught to think, you have to be critical of a system that raised you and shaped you. You have to go against the nature of what normal is and accept yourself. And then you ahve to find out how you want to change the context of your life. alkohol amkes me miserable, and everyone i know drinks Find people you can exist with with out alcohol My father is violent Create an existence were you are independant from him School is terrible translate My class mates bully me daily Find another school thes are simple i know, and jsut examples. Now i know you asked why do i have to do all this hard work and i threw some of the most difficult work and ideas at you. But the things is all what ive jsut said is the reasonalbe arguemtn for you nature, essence and existence and a way to improve it. when you ask why, reason is not a tool that can answer. its like trying to build a ship using lead, sure maybe it can be done, but its deffinately not the best way. Refelection, abstract thought, contemplation, emotion, empathy. those are the tools to arrive at an answer. If reason was used, human life wouldn't really have value. If you were the head of state and only used reason, you would quickly realize, human lives are not what drives you foward, what makes progress and creates a super power. And lives could turn into numbers. Sure educated people anda strong work force is good reasonable arguments to have a population, but only if they are educated or strong. Using reason to determine worth of life can lead to terrible ideas or no answers. You have to work hard right now, because you are worth it depsise allt he pain you are in you are worth it, and you deserve to be your best you. And if you don't liek working 8 hours a day then sleep 8 hours and then have 8 hours for yourself. Then there are options, but because you born into this context you ahve to work hard to get to those oprions. It is hard to change your enviroment. You have to stay alive becuase, you know a humans life has worth and you are one. When you see another in pain you wish he wouldn't ahve to be, when i see your words and want to help you but am incapable i still try. You have worth because of all the thigns you have not done yet, and all the people who have not enjoyed you future self.

Cooking/Nutrition for Depression. I'm having trouble keeping up with basic cooking. What are the easiest/healthiest meals I can have to keep my nutrition up? I've been eating so many plain turkey sandwiches.,"Can you just get one of those packages of pre-washed spinach and add those to your sandwiches as a start? Take what you have working for you and try to cram as many nutrients in as possible. Spinach is a good choice because it's pretty nutrient dense as opposed to lettuce, and it's easy to add to stuff. You can even grab a can on minestrone (or any other type) soup, heat it up and dump a bunch of spinach into it to boost the vegetable content. My go to recently has been a spinach salad with goat cheese and balsamic vinaigrette dressing. Maybe some day I'll get fancy and add onions or peppers or whatever to make it a real salad, but at this point, it's better than the grilled cheese by itself or whatever else I'm eating.

one question. I'll keep it simple. Can there be happiness in despair? Because I think I felt it and I want to kill off any hope that's left for me.,"That's a pretty profound question, but I think happiness is something that a lot of people don't understand. In a period or prolonged period of despair, I don't believe there can be happiness at all, and it's only after that period has been solved, over, attacked enough by effort and time, that you can start experiencing happiness. I don't think happiness and gratitude should be forced, or you should try to feel happy when you truly cannot feel happy. I'm still going through that period, and there might be rivets or jewels of happiness along the way, but they are fleeting and leave very quickly. The whole reason why people despair is because they are tied so strongly to negative emotional memories that they outweigh any trivial positive emotional memories. Think about it, which memories are the quickest, strongest, and most easily able to be remembered for you? The most emotional ones. If your most emotional memories are negative, you will be in despair. On the converse, if one's most emotional memories are positive, you will be in a state of happiness. There is a way to end your despair, you just have to face it head on and let go of everything, and keep trying to let go and accept. Very few people have any science on this and might be the thing we need to explore the most as a society as a whole.",0,,,

How long it will last i cannot say, when it will end i cannot say either. But take it one day at a time. Do things that are only necessary for your existence. And those that are extra if you are not up to it do it. Within the relationship i am sure there were flaws on both parts, beat yourself up about them.

Sure things suck, most of the time for longer than we'd like but there are alot of things that make life on this planet right now worth living. I personally am not religious.

I'm still technically Depressed, I have been most of my life and likely will be until it's over or I find what it is i need to do with myself to get there.

Apparently it's living in a van and not staying anywhere long enough to feel stagnant. I'm not at all a people person and i have a family full of happy go lucky dimwits who talk nonsense and gossip repeating the same routine like that i what life is. That's not what i want.

There's an entire world out there, look at the room around you and remember that's less than a microbe in the grand scheme of things.

It's never easy to do, but I can promise you that you are so much stronger than you know, and there are always people willing to listen and to try to understand what you're going through. Lastly, I hope you don't die. Not until you've been able to live the life that you want, the life that you deserve to have.

Weight loss and pills. Anyone lose weight from their depression pills?

"Do you think love from the right people can fix you?.

It's definitely taken a huge toll on me, but it's not the only reason why I suffer today.

"People who say it gets better don't really know what depression is. I just read yet another it gets better article trying to convince teenagers to not commit suicide. I never tell that lie. I never say it gets better. I say you need to learn how to fight through it. People that think that it gets better do not know what true depression is. They might have had a shitty thing happen to them where they thought for one moment that they didn't want to live any more, but they don't know what it means to live a life of feeling that way. They don't know what it is to lay awake at night, wandering why you can't sleep, and why you are drowning again, when you have been doing so well, only to realize you forgot to take your meds the past couple of days. They will never know what it feels like to accept that this is your life. You will forever be fighting it. You will pray for God to give you peace of mind, and the only way he can give it to you is through a pill that still fails you sometimes. It is tough knowing that some people will never understand.","People always tell me ''it could be worse''. It could be worse? No, it really couldn't be much worse. This is a disease of the brain - the part that makes out the very essence of our self, the part that tells us about the world around us, that allows us to draw conclusions about the world, have morality and feel everything from the love poets have written about since the advent of letters to the soul crushing despair ahead of the final override of our animal nature: suicide. If you can't rely on that, you are fucked. If you suddenly can't feel some emotions anymore, you're fucked. If you no longer feel the moral qualms that have guided you for years, you're fucked. Please tell me what is worse than only being able to use a computer to interact with your environment and that computer being broken in a way we don't understand? Just that it is worse than that, because there is no you. You are the computer and your network card is fried, your CPU has a tear and your battery no longer holds charge...and there's nothing that can be done. All you can do is grit your teeth and keep going. Try to adjust to the fact your version of reality is not actually real and that information you are getting about your body is downright not true - apart from when it is, because if your brain believes you have no energy, you sure as fuck have no energy. Try to not let the lack of love and happiness and the very concept of hope throw you into that pit of despair. Now, pray tell me, what precisely could be worse? I'd rather be hungry with a broken arm, because then I would still know that it is me who is hungry and that my arm hurts. I could still believe that may be tomorrow there will be food. I would feel the natural drive of self preservation to bandage that arm. You have no concept of what a malfunctioning brain means and I hope that you never will, but please do not compare it with other experiences, because there is nothing like it short of hypoxia at the summit of Mt. Everest - there you are starving the brain of oxygen and get an impression of it slowly shutting down. People pay a lot of money so they can have the experience and know they pushed through within the day it takes them to do the last stage. I am trapped there. Every day of my life. I can't descend. Ask someone who went up the mountain if there is anything worse. Just that I'm also walking into school/work each day. I do chores. I get dressed. I pay bills.

Does anyone else want to kill themselves but are too scared to do it?. The title says it. I just want to die but i just cant bring myself to do it. Ive always been this way.

But I sure as hell don't want to keep on living either...,0,,,

"Every day I waste a 1.99 on OkCupid boost, just to get no views.. And it really hurts me.",Don't be hurt. All dating sites are money scams in disguise.

I’m a fuck up. All I ever do is compare myself to others because the only way I get self worth. I was doing so fucking good and now back at square one,"I hear you. So well.

Memory is fucking shot to hell. Everything I read about improving memory and remembering things says you have to be emotionally invested in what you want to remember in some way. What a cruel fucking joke that is.,"I'm wondering if depression is affecting my memory as well. I used to be able to remember people's names pretty well, and I used to be able to retain a lot of information and remember things about people. Now I have to write everything down or I *will* forget it, and my brain becomes overloaded with information extremely quickly, so I can only take in so much. I don't know where my ability to remember helpful information about people (favorite color, birthday, etc.) even went. I'm not sure I'm even fully processing what I'm learning in school.",0,,,

"The dilemma I'm facing every day. Don't be sad and quiet, people don't like sad and quiet. Don't pretend to be happy and cheerful, people can feel you are pretending, and they don't like disingenuity.","But then it can be even worse.. If we honestly, truly act like we feel 100% of the time, there really isn't much hope to establish any real connection to anyone.. It's really fucking difficult to wear a mask all the time, but at least it's marginally better that being alone all the time, isn't it? Most people don't want to associate with someone who is severely depressed and deathly anxious, and I can't even blame them.. If I do act like how I feel, I'm probably a nightmare to be around, because there's an aura of sadness and hopelessness that surrounds me. How can I expect anyone to approach me? Even if there is someone who does, it would be crazy to expect them to completely accept a miserable wreck like me. I mean, I can't just take and not give.. And then there's the people who act all smug and give you all that fucking moronic rose-tinted glasses shit with an air of superiority, a la /r/wowthanksimcured, and you feel even worse. It does feel like shit, but I've managed to construct separate personalities for interacting with my family and for anything job-related, because at a workplace, nobody gives a fuck if you're rotting on the inside due to over a decade of depression, anxiety, and self-hatred. So, while I wish I could agree with what you say, it's just not applicable..",0,,,
