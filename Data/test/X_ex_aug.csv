How do you feel. What is life with depression? Tell me your story,"To answer your question, I'm actually feeling alright today. Had an existential crisis last night and probably would have ended up killing myself or at the very least cutting myself if it wasn't for my dog licking my hand as I layed in bed crying myself to sleep (she's NEVER an affectionate dog, it took me a minute to even realise that she was actually licking my hand and I wasn't imagining shit). Thanks, Charlie.  Anyways, for me depression is like absolute insanity. It's not just sadness or feeling like killing myself every other week. Just pure insanity. The best example I can give is probably two years ago, seventh grade. That was probably the lowest I had ever been. Every night when I went to sleep, I'd stay up on my phone. Not because I wanted to be, because it kept me from going to sleep and having the same nightmares I had every night. And then I'd look at the time, which by now was probably about 12 AM, realise how absolutely sad and pathetic I was and turn on some emo music, usually being something like Set it Off's I'll Sleep When I'm Dead and listen to that as I (literally) sadistically laugh and cry myself to sleep. Some nights, that kind of stuff never happened. I'd have a peaceful sleep. Some nights I'd stay up all night debating whether I should text the suicide hotline, doing so, and it being no help whatsoever.  So I'd get, maybe six hours of sleep at most. Before I'm woken up and have to get ready for school. How am I woken up? By my parents during the best part of my dream or the most peaceful part of my nightmare. Which already started my day off terribly. Then for an hour I'd be in the bathroom once again listening to emo music as I let the shower water run. My favourite songs to listen to were usually just about anything by Hollywood Undead. Not something a twelve year old should be listening to, sure. But it was a way to cope with my depression. As I listen to those songs, once again sadistically laughing at my own pain and often times end up cutting myself. I never cut myself deep, I was far to afraid of doing that. But... I enjoyed seeing the blood come out. I didn't cut for any sort of high or release of pain. It was sort of hard to explain. I was never addicted to cutting, I could stop or start whenever I wanted. Sometimes stopping for months at a time, but seeing the blood, made me feel happy. If you could have seen my eyes, especially when I cut myself, you wouldn't have seen any traces of a twelve year old. You'd see an insane person desperately trying to grasp on to the last straw of sanity, but nothing else. Some days I'd debate whether I should do a sort of murder-suicide thing. Or at the very least murder those who have caused me pain and suffering. Sometimes I'd have very and scarily elaborate plans on how I'd trick, kidnap, or kill my family. Things that you'd never expect from a twelve year old. But quite frankly, I might have physically been twelve, but my depression had probably aged and matured me way faster. The ride to school was probably the most traumatic for me. The ride was only about ten minutes (five minutes to school, five minutes in the carpool line). But those ten minutes were full of tests streaming down my face, me punching myself or ripping my hair out, or destroying my notebooks or pencils. Sometimes because I just really didn't want to go to school. Sometimes because my social anxiety got the best of me. Sometimes for reasons I don't even know. Me and my grandma would usually sit at the front of the school for about an hour or two, I'm sitting there trying to find a way to hurt myself because I'm angry, but don't want to let my anger out on her, and she's crying because she's absolutely lost on how to help me. I'd usually end up getting to school about a good three hours late.  In school, I don't remember anything. Maybe it's because I was just walking around the school like a robot. Class for an hour, find your next class, repeat. In class, I'd have my head down in a book (not paying attention to the teacher whatsoever), I'd be mindlessly reciting the emo songs I listen to in my head, or I'd be talking to my friend AIDEN. (Yes, his name is in all caps). What I do definitely remember is hating all of my peers. Hell, I still hate them. It's not my hatred for them itself. It's just I can't stand how immature, idiotic, and stupid they were. Like who the hell goes around sticking Tide pods in their mouths for views on social media? Or who thinks it's funny to go around telling people to kill themselves because you heard your favourite edgy YouTuber say it and now you think it's hilarious to do so. Or why do you think it's cool and okay to curse every five seconds and use the N-word? Or why do you think that because you saw Kim Kardashian half naked in some photo shoot that you can show up to school with hardly any clothes on or sag and talk about fucking whores because your favourite rapper said it in their newest song? Act your own god damn age, quit trying to act like someone three times your age while being as immature as a kindergartener.  More on AIDEN: AIDEN sort of just appeared out of nowhere. I don't know when or why I came up with him, I just sort of did. I'm not schizophrenic, he was 100% my own voice talking back to me in my head, but I enjoyed pretending to have someone to talk to. Someone who walked around with me everyday, knew exactly what I was thinking, and could relate to me all the time. Someone who (though was just my own voice), talked me out of suicide many times back in 7th grade. But slowly I started treating AIDEN a lot more like a real person. To the point where I could have easily been mistaken as someone with schizophrenia.  At home I'd just go into my room and basically lock myself in. My door was never locked, my parents could come in and out as they pleased, but I would just hand out under the covers all day. I didn't want to see light, light didn't want to see me. I didn't bother with homework. I figured, I fail, I fail. I really had just given up with life at that point. The only reason why I hadn't killed myself was probably because I was too sad and lazy to bother trying. Occasionally I'd talk to AIDEN or watch YouTube or something, but most times I ended up listening to hypnosis. Hypnosis for me was like a way to escape real life. Like meditation, but instead of being left alone with my sad and depressing thoughts, I could listen to someone else. At first it was a nice little escape, but then it more or less because an addiction. An odd strange one that I'd never be able to explain to anyone, but an addiction none the less. I'd try to listen to hypnosis any time I could even if that meant going into my room away from family to listen to it. It kind of gave me the same high that cutting, smoking, drugs, or porn give other people. Even though it was just hypnosis, it really did become unhealthy. Before I knew it, it was time for me to go to bed. And then the whole cycle would repeat itself over and over and over and over and over again. It was the same routine, same schedule, same insanity over and over again. This sounds like more is going on than just depression, right? Like some other underlying mental illness. But this is all depression and a bit of social anxiety. No MPD, no schizophrenia, no bipolar disorder, I'm not a psychopath or sociopath. This was all thanks to my depression.  No one actually knew how bad my mental state was. I never told anyone. I was diagnosed with depression and put on meds, but if anyone really knew how bad it was, I likely truly would have been put in a mental health hospital. This is where the most insane part was, since being on my meds, I'm a lot more stable. But I miss being the way I was. Even though they were supposed to, my meds didn't help my depression. It really just made me more stable. Now without AIDEN or cutting myself or the enjoyment of listening to emo music as I sadistically laugh and cry at the same time, I just feel empty. Though I was completely fucked up, it was still fun a times to laugh at how much I hate myself and my life. Now I can't do those things anymore. It's like being insane was a big part of me and my depression. The insanity itself was taken away, but the depression was still left. Now there's just a big, empty, dark hole.",0,,,

jobs. does anyone here know any way a freshman can get a job in california. im just hoping that getting a job and earning a little bit of money will help my depression to calm down or not be as severe.,"Freshman at high school or university? If HS, you can get a work permit at 15, I think. You are supposed to have one while working and under 18. As for finding one at that age, most people I know were put into food or retail. The coffee shops, fast food, some with cars made pizza. The generally higher theaters of young women. They are simple jobs that do not require much training and younger employees help keep the younger crowds that enter. There should be someone in his school as a counselor with information on work permits. Edit: It is also great that you want to work. Having the money can give more space to breathe with invoices and you can start building some retirement money. In addition, having the experience will help obtain better jobs. Just remember that you don't have to save everything. If all you do is work and your money returns to food/invoices/rent/etc., work will become a load. Put each payment check aside as a background. At first it will not be much, but after a few months you will have a good change of reservation. Do you want to go to a weekend getaway? Do it. Looking for a new TV. Buy it. In general, I reserve $ 100 months and I generally buy something I had wanted after a few months, but I could not justify. It works well. I still had another money to eat or do things, but I got a great reward every few months.",1,Freshman in high school or college?|,Freshman in high school or college?,Freshman in high school or college?

Now I have a question to ask you, why would others be happy with you when you are not happy with yourself? The point is that we must first develop self -love and personal care. Because without him, we will depend too much on others and that becomes expensive because anyone's life is perfect and everyone has their own problems to deal with. Although other people want to love and support you, they can only do it to some extent. The rest of the void within you can only fill alone. I know you don't feel it, but being able to learn to self -love is the key to happiness because it is when you feel that your life is in your control again, not in others.

The rare moments I leave my depression are worse. I only realize how far I've fallen behind.. Depression is better than anxiety for me.,"You realize what s wrong. There's many things wrong and even though you're depressed you are comfortable in some way. Because realizing you must change your ways, can put some one in a discomfort zone. Truth is, you have to leave your comfort zones behind sometime in order to work on your happiness.  An example Some one who is desperately trying to lose wieght will put himself ahead with a struggle to his mind and body, but he knows that the outcome is what matters. He has to deal with discomfort to loose his wieght. There's no other way, that's just how life is. A surgery to lose wieght would be a pass.  There's no free passes or shortcuts in life and many learn the hard way.",0,,,

Laziness or lack of motivation.. How have some of you battled depression related laziness?,"Hi Talk2muchaa,  Lik onus111 suggested, 'feeling like doing something' just does not happen. If you're deeply unhappy with a lack of activity in your life, you just need to force yourself to do it - That's the sad reality of it. HOWEVER, that doesn't mean that there aren't ways to make FORCING yourself 'easier' on your mind and less stressful. If you want to build a house consisting of a 1000 bricks, take 30 seconds a day to lay 3 bricks and in one year, you will have a house.  You can't punish yourself for not building Rome in a day. You will go on Twitch and see streamers who are making millions... YouTubers who are making millions. I mean fuck, PewDiePie has 56 million subscribers.  But that shit didn't happen in just one day. You need to break shit up into increments. Perhaps others don't have to do this. But it's the only way I've found to get anything done. If you want to learn a language, go on Duolingo. Set a '10 points per day' challenge. Yes, it's jack-shit in terms of work. It takes literally 2 minutes a day, BUT- it's something.  Try and ignore your brain saying Increase the goal to 50 a day, we're getting fuck-all done because this will break your discipline and you'll go back to 0 a day.  Consistently doing 10 a day for 11 days, is better than doing 50 a day for 2 days, burning out and stopping altogether. The key to beating depression-induced laziness is TINY, incremental steps. For example, I'm learning Calculus on Khan Academy. One. Lesson. A Day.  That's right- the average Khan video is around 10 minutes. I do one video a day. I am slowly, but consistently learning. Each day I go over the notes from the previous day. The problem isn't volume- it's consistency.",0,,,

Break even.. Do you think my partner whom broke up with me because of depression is feeling as hurt as I am right now? My former partner seems to be doing very well.,"For your depression or your partners? My ex broke with me for hers. At that moment he said that he still loved me but that he needed to improve (really true, it was crazy). Recently we talked after a few months from North Carolina and that was leveled with antidepressants. His pain was not the same as mine. His emotions were flat. Anhedonia Sadness, anger, frustration, confusion, despair I felt are emotions that was unable to feel. I know this because I was very depressed years ago. Even now, since it is in SSRI's, and with that months later, I do not believe that your pain is even close to what mine was. I think his pain is more in repentance. Sincerely, I doubt that it ever really hurt by this breakup: by the time it is out of medications and capable of feeling those raw emotions again, it will probably be a total of 1-2 years from the break. She will only have to deal with repentance, if even that. Of course, a cynical side of me wants me to feel what I did. I want her to cry the loss of our relationship like me. I want you to think about what we had, let those good memories fill her with the positive emotions we had together and follow them with sadness about her understanding. But when I really think about it, I know I don't want that to happen. He cried enough when he began to sink lower in depression. The outbursts, frustration, the fear of losing myself.

"Natural remedies for fighting depression/social anxiety?. So, yeah. The title pretty much sums it up. I would like to hear personal stories of success(and also failure).","Supplements:  ---  Fish oil: There is some evidence that fish oil with 2 EPA to 1 DHA ratio helps with depression. Helps me a bit but maybe placebo effect.  5-HTP: Tried while really depressed/anxious and it didn't help. SSRIs didn't either and only a long acting Benzo did anything beneficial. Might try again later.  Valerian root: Calms some people down. Doesn't do much for me.  Rhodiola Rosea: Apparently gives you more energy while keeping you calm. Maybe a bit more energy for me but could be placebo effect.  St. John's Wart: Supposed to be a natural antidepressant. I am thinking of trying it soon.  Magnesium: Helps some people (assuming deficiency exists) but I have not tried it yet.  Alcohol: Works great to calm social anxiety in a moment! Don't consume if taking prescription drugs. Consume in moderation if you need to drive home.  Marijuana: Can really elevate mood, depends on the person. Can be combined with alcohol for added effect. Don't drive at all after using it. Don't use if illegal where you live or your employer drug tests.  ---  Lifestyle:  ---  Exercise: Some people rave that being active reduces anxiety and depression. In my case the gym is actually a trigger. I do enjoy going for a walk on a nice day though.  Diet: I have started eating better and less. I have lost substantial weight and feel physically better. The sense of accomplishment and feeling better about my body has probably helped my depression.  Travel: If you can afford it take a vacation and go see the world. Go alone so that you can discover your true self and not be at the whim of another person. It was an extremely positive experience for me.  ---",0,,,

"Do you think some jobs are really meant for people with mental illnesses?. I mean to say that those jobs are only limited to people with depression, just that a good fit Edit: Jobs like being an artist, working in the film industry, therapists, nurses, etc.","Every job you mentioned will have significant pressure, which can lead to more depression. Artist - a friend of mine is a indie musician type of artist. Born in a rich family, great social support with what she does, good education. She accepts that being an artist doesn't bring good money because interest and passion matter more. Still has been clinically depressed for years. Still making meager money. Every person I can think I'd back in college that studied fine arts or art history has rich families so they can continue to pursue a masters or phd in areas they like without worries. For those who don't have a privileged background, starving artists are no cliche - that's the norm. And I think people who are already depressed are unlikely to find poverty to be a good escape. Film - very unstable depending what you work on. Networking is extremely important and you must be socially savvy because it's all about power and money, even in independent films. This means competition and getting funding will be incredibly difficult. Therapists - you need good education and superb social skills and emotional control. A depressed person is unlikely to have the latter. All require years of training. Nurses - I don't need to elaborate more. Just google how many perfectly healthy, capable, and motivated nurses who still got burnt out and depressed. It's long work hours, high pressure and physically demanding to boot. What I want to say is this: any profession will have major shortcoming and sacrifices. There's no such thing as profession that are suitable for depressed people. Any job can turn a healthy person depressed - on the contrary, any depressed person can find recovery by engaging in other professions and become successful.",0,,,
