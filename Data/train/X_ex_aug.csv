"Do you know EXACTLY what you need to do to feel better, but it's just so damn hard?. I thought long and hard today and... I guess I always kinda knew the bits and pieces of problems I have, but I pieced them all together today.  My depression started because I was isolated during a school semester (plus hammered with various stress, family and medical). And so.. my self esteem dropped. When I was able to get home, I still felt isolated because being away at school for so long... it felt like I didn't have the same interests as my friends at home anymore. My self esteem continued to drop. I separated from my toxic family, and felt a lot of loss. So... about now, my self esteem is rock bottom. Now it's hard to find connections with people, because I fall into cycles of feeling so negatively about myself. Like a hole I don't have the strength to pull myself out of. I just wish I had someone who could throw me a line, and work with me for a little while until I can get back on my feet! But.. I'm alone. What can I do KNOWING this, but being unable to act on it?

"What's the point?. Why am I supposed to stay alive? I don't want to reproduce and I don't care for anyone in my life. I don't see a point, especially if I'm just going to die in the end.","It's a sad reality that everything comes to an end and that we're not given an exact explanation of why we're here or what the meaning of it all is. The way I see it is that we're here to give our life meaning one way or another. Since we don't know the meaning we have to make the meaning. Some people find that through their work, family, helping others, etc. Life is full of endless possibilities of what we can do with it. It's hard getting to the point where we feel like we're happy or accomplished but that in itself is another aspect of life and finding meaning. For some people it could take most of their lives to find the meaning that they were looking for and in my view I'd rather spend my whole life looking for that meaning and helping who I can along the way than to just accept that there's no meaning to it and end it since that's not really an answer. I may never get the answer myself but I can at least enjoy the journey leading to the end and maybe that in and of itself was the meaning all along. You'll meet many varieties of people throughout your life who will give you different perspectives of what meaning is to them and maybe that will help you on your journey and maybe it won't. We have the time we're given and what we do with it is dependent on us. Even after we die and join the rest of the universe in it's infinite there'll still be people around who will say, Hey remember u/OkayScience, I want to do what he did and live my life to its fullest. We can still be remembered for the life we lived even after we're gone and in that way we'll essentially live forever. This is the way I see life and it helps me from time to time. I still have my bad days and sometimes consider if it's all worth it but then I just keep going because I won't know if I just stop here. Plus it helps talking to people about it at times and if you do feel like talking about it more feel free to send me a message. Keep going with the journey and stay strong since you'll find your meaning in time.",0,,,

Cooking/Nutrition for Depression. I'm having trouble keeping up with basic cooking. What are the easiest/healthiest meals I can have to keep my nutrition up?

Take what you have working for you and try to cram as many nutrients in as possible. Spinach is a good choice because it's pretty nutrient dense as opposed to lettuce, and it's easy to add to stuff. You can even grab a can on minestrone (or any other type) soup, heat it up and dump a bunch of spinach into it to boost the vegetable content.  My go to recently has been a spinach salad with goat cheese and balsamic vinaigrette dressing. Maybe some day I'll get fancy and add onions or peppers or whatever to make it a real salad, but at this point, it's better than the grilled cheese by itself or whatever else I'm eating.

"Life without Joy. I've been dealing with depression for (at least) three years now, with varying levels of severity. There have been some real lows, but I know that's to be expected. What concerns me more than the presence of these lows, however, is the complete absence of highs. In other words, I feel no joy whatsoever. I really don't remember the last time I did.  Despite seeing a counselor regularly, working out 2-3 times each week, meditating daily, and trying out multiple medications, I've seen no improvement in that regard. It takes a lot for me to do all of those things, so it's obviously pretty discouraging that I'm not seeing any results.  Anyone else have this issue?","I feel only bad things, too. I can laugh and joke with my buddies, but it just feels hollow and empty on the inside. I even come to think, that I often times smile and laugh, cause I know a normal person would do this and I did it once, so to don't look like a freak, I do it at the right times.  But I'm never excited these days. I can't even remember the last time I was. Even when I decided to lose my virginity to a prostitute when I was around 30, I had some concerns but I wasn't excited. Birthdays and partys, I knew I couldn't wait for some when I was in my early twenties. Nowadays, I actually have to push myself to go out and meet friends, even though I absolutly KNOW it will be a nice evening.  So, I understand what is up with you.

"Do any of you guys feel like me?. For some background, I'm 18 and in my freshman year of university.  For a couple months now I've just been feeling sorta weird. It's like a long funk. I don't know how to describe it. If I had to choose, I'd say I feel empty or indifferent.

I'm guessing you feel kind of lost and without a direction and you just are following the path that you feel is required of you.

You will pray for God to give you peace of mind, and the only way he can give it to you is through a pill that still fails you sometimes.

This is a disease of the brain - the part that makes out the very essence of our self, the part that tells us about the world around us, that allows us to draw conclusions about the world, have morality and feel everything from the love poets have written about since the advent of letters to the soul crushing despair ahead of the final override of our animal nature: suicide. If you can't rely on that, you are fucked. If you suddenly can't feel some emotions anymore, you're fucked. If you no longer feel the moral qualms that have guided you for years, you're fucked. Please tell me what is worse than only being able to use a computer to interact with your environment and that computer being broken in a way we don't understand? Just that it is worse than that, because there is no you. You are the computer and your network card is fried, your CPU has a tear and your battery no longer holds charge...and there's nothing that can be done. All you can do is grit your teeth and keep going. Try to adjust to the fact your version of reality is not actually real and that information you are getting about your body is downright not true - apart from when it is, because if your brain believes you have no energy, you sure as fuck have no energy. Try to not let the lack of love and happiness and the very concept of hope throw you into that pit of despair. Now, pray tell me, what precisely could be worse? I'd rather be hungry with a broken arm, because then I would still know that it is me who is hungry and that my arm hurts. I could still believe that may be tomorrow there will be food. I would feel the natural drive of self preservation to bandage that arm. You have no concept of what a malfunctioning brain means and I hope that you never will, but please do not compare it with other experiences, because there is nothing like it short of hypoxia at the summit of Mt. Everest - there you are starving the brain of oxygen and get an impression of it slowly shutting down. People pay a lot of money so they can have the experience and know they pushed through within the day it takes them to do the last stage. I am trapped there. Every day of my life. I can't descend.

This may seem like useless advice, but it can greatly help if you tell the other people exactly how you're feeling and ask them to try and help you. Nobody will ever be inside your head and able to experience exactly what you are feeling, but by talking to them and letting them know, you can help them to understand you.

one question. I'll keep it simple. Can there be happiness in despair? Because I think I felt it and I want to kill off any hope that's left for me.,"That's a pretty profound question, but I think happiness is something that a lot of people don't understand. In a period or prolonged period of despair, I don't believe there can be happiness at all, and it's only after that period has been solved, over, attacked enough by effort and time, that you can start experiencing happiness. I don't think happiness and gratitude should be forced, or you should try to feel happy when you truly cannot feel happy. I'm still going through that period, and there might be rivets or jewels of happiness along the way, but they are fleeting and leave very quickly.  The whole reason why people despair is because they are tied so strongly to negative emotional memories that they outweigh any trivial positive emotional memories. Think about it, which memories are the quickest, strongest, and most easily able to be remembered for you? The most emotional ones.  If your most emotional memories are negative, you will be in despair. On the converse, if one's most emotional memories are positive, you will be in a state of happiness.  There is a way to end your despair, you just have to face it head on and let go of everything, and keep trying to let go and accept. Very few people have any science on this and might be the thing we need to explore the most as a society as a whole.",0,,,

I'm curious to know how y'all did it.,"I watched a short video once (I'm sure can google but I'm on phone and about to get in car) that compared depression to a big black dog. On bad days the dog is giant and weighing you down and on better days the dog is small and at your feet. This helped me accept a lot more about my life and my depression rather than constantly wishing it could just go away. I would get so mad at myself for being angry/sad but now I know it's like owning an animal--you take care of it and it won't bite you, at least not as much anyway. It's part of who you are and that is okay. I do not have severe depression so I am not on meds, so can't speak for those folks who are, but for me exercise and doing things for me (rather than constantly for others or other people's approval) really helped. It's like learning to be selfish in a good way. Eating less carbs and gluten helped too as they tended to make my body more sluggish which did t help when I already felt sad/slow/tired. I eat a lot more protein and fresh veggies now and I think there is a big difference--especially after 6+ months. I still drink alcohol but now a limited variety of stuff that I truly like the flavor of rather than eh it's here so I'll drink it. Also I don't drink when I'm in a bad place or anything traumatic happened that day/week. It's just a recipe for bad. I don't do any other drugs and I'm allergic to smoke so can't speak on that. I also drink 0 caffeine but that's mostly due to stomach issues--not sure if that would help or not. Good luck!",0,,,

Is anyone else incredibly funny irl but miserable af when they get home?. What kind of jokes do you do? Who knows what you really feel inside? Why do we rely on other people's happiness?,"It's fucking weird.  I often have to bring every ounce of willpower up to bring myself to go to a party with frends, even though I know it will be good.  But once I'm there, I'm often the Life of the Party, or so I think. I had people coming up to me, greeting me by my name and telling me how much fun they had last time we had met each other. Which was a year ago. For the first and last time since. I barely remembered their faces and not a single name. So I guess I left an impression.  I really like to banter, to do play on words and take words from their mouth and turn them around in a fun way. I joke and tell stories with expressive facial expressions and big gestures. I'm sarcastic, sometimes even cynical. And I joke a lot about myself, mostly in a non-flattering way.  I think people like me in general, I seldomly had someone outright refuse to interact with me.  But on the other hand, as soon as I come home, I feel a crushing void and I feel alone and that everything is pointless. Those feelings remain in my day-to-day life. And it starts to interfere with my work, for example. I am not one to contain my feelings in an enviroment where I spend most of my days and life in. My boss already told me once, in a pretty long phase of being really depressed, that even my collegues said that something must be seriously wrong and the have no fun working around and with me if I'm in such mood.  I can be fun at work, too. I made my co-workers laugh on a lot f different occasions. But that happens in good phases. But there are very bad phases where I, at best, don't say a single word all day unless absolutly necessary and at worst, I am filled with rage the whole day and can't contain it.  Last week I was as close to quitting my job as I was never before. Maybe it would be best for all.   Whatever, long story short:  I think I can be really funny, too. Despite the fact I feel fucking miserable inside or do not feel anything at all.",0,,,

Break even.. Do you think my partner whom broke up with me because of depression is feeling as hurt as I am right now? My former partner seems to be doing very well.,"Because of your depression or your partners?   My ex broke up with me because of hers. At the time she said she still loved me but needed to get better (really true, she was a nutcase). We recently talked after a few months of NC and her getting leveled out on anti-depressants. Her hurt was not the same as mine. Her emotions were flat-lined. Anhedonia. The sadness, anger, frustration, confusion, despair that I felt are emotions she was incapable of feeling. I know this because I was severely depressed myself years ago. Even now since she is on SSRI's, and with it being months later, I don't think her hurt is even close to what mine was. I think her hurt is more in regret. I honestly doubt she will ever truly hurt over this breakup - by the time she's off the meds and capable of feeling those raw emotions again, it will probably be a total of 1-2 years since the breakup. She'll only have to deal with regret - if even that.   Of course some cynical side of me wants her to feel what I did. I want her to grieve the loss of our relationship like I did. I want her to think about what we had, let those good memories fill her with the positive emotions we had together, and have them followed up by sadness over the realization she lost it. But when I really think about it, I know I don't want that to happen. She cried enough when she started sinking lower into depression. The outbursts, the frustration, the fear of losing me. I remember how much that happened. She hurt too, it just happened for months before the breakup, where mine was after.",0,Because of your depression or your partners?|,Because of your depression or your partners?,Because of your depression or your partners?
"Sometimes I wonder if I really even have depression. I was diagnosed 2 or 3 years ago by my family doctor, who prescribed SSRIs \(which I never took\). My moods range from suicidal and self harming to just feeling out of sorts and not at peace with myself. Sometimes I go months without feeling like that, sometimes it seems to come about every few weeks and lasts for weeks at a time.  I don't know, I sometimes compare myself to my boyfriend who has a team of psychologists and psychiatrists working to diagnose him, whereas I just went to my family doctor, filled in a questionnaire, and boom got labelled with depression. I wonder if I'm faking it or blowing my feelings out of proportion, especially comparing it to more serious cases of mental illness.  Does anyone else ever feel this way? How do you deal with it?","Just because you don't or can't have access to that level of mental health care does not mean your own mental illness is any less valid.  I have always had a team, a prescribing doctor, therapist, and GP. Sometimes specifically a team that works together, sometimes just doctor's that kind of share notes but don't ever meet up. I am very lucky. Very few people get this level of treatment. Any number of genuine suicidal thoughts is too many. Everyone gets depressed, but when you stay there long enough to consider life actually painful to live you have depression. It can be really hard not to play mental illness Olympics. But someone else struggling more does not take away from your own struggle. Your feelings, your illness, are real. They're valid. They have NOTHING to do with anyone else's struggles.

Whether it's the friend that lives far away from you or any person that read your post and identified with your story. You, staying alive and sharing this would also do wonders for trasgenders who have trouble being accepted by their families or close ones. Depression causes us to feel helpless and unloved.

The term fetishizing is used in a harsh, accusatory, pejorative way, blaming the characters for perpetually watching their lives through the blackest prism, but the truth is they just do not know any better than to do so. Furthermore, fetishes are often believed to be shameful and obscene in nature, because such random, nonsexual items PRODUCE intense satisfaction, whereas people that are accused of fetishizing sadness are just sheltering themselves (if i fuck myself up, no one else will).",0,,,

Much of Sylvia Plath's poetry centres around mental health and depression, if that's of interest, and while it's not something I've read 'The Bell Jar' (which is prose) is also supposed to be very good, according to a former acquaintance of mine. And I recently finished watching an anime called Orange which was mostly very good at dealing with the issue, the one caveat being that characters tend to talk about 'saving' people quite a lot, which can be a little bit galling (lol). Music-wise, Brand New have done a number of songs which either deal with depression (or emotions that can be closely linked to depression) or are pretty evocative in that sense tonally-speaking.

Make a list of such jobs that you can opt for as per your top three skill-sets. 3. The next thing is to look for free or paid online resources to learn about that job and start applying.  I would suggest starting with some easy job that you can find without any trouble. For instance, you can do data entry in the beginning. After a few months, you can start doing transcription work, and then maybe move on to become a virtual assistant. So in this way, you will ultimately start earning a decent earning on your own.

I want to die. That's all I have to say,"Most of us on this subreddit have been/are there. I know i have. I tend to dwell on the past far too often and besides it's obvious drawbacks it does have one advantage. Remembering the time i did want to die and how I thought there was no other way out. But I decided to live and I haven't actually wanted to die since. Sure things suck, most of the time for longer than we'd like but there are alot of things that make life on this planet right now worth living. I personally am not religious. I think once your dead it's lights out and I very much enjoy consciousness. I only felt what it was like living without it once or twice and those were not pleasant experiences. I'm still technically Depressed, I have been most of my life and likely will be until it's over or I find what it is i need to do with myself to get there. What helped me go from uber frustrated to content is to continue to evolve. I cut off everyone i knew and reevaluated what I want in life... Apparently it's living in a van and not staying anywhere long enough to feel stagnant. I'm not at all a people person and i have a family full of happy go lucky dimwits who talk nonsense and gossip repeating the same routine like that i what life is. That's not what i want. To be happy you need to forget about everyone and their bullshit, and be who you are where you are. Experience what life is, don't waste it and don't throw it away before you've lived it fully. I'm stuck right now, been hibernating as my little brothers personal housekeeper because my anxiety drives me to near agoraphobia. But once i get out of here I'll take all the lessons I've learned on /r/vandwellers and start my life as i know it should be and hopefully that brings me piece of mind for once. That's what works for me, but if your not an antisocial INTP then you might not want to live in a van lol. But I'm sure there is some way you see life should be... There's an entire world out there, look at the room around you and remember that's less than a microbe in the grand scheme of things. Do what what want do what drives you, not what you think is expected of you. It's your life, you are the one setting the standards and accepting them. Fuck everyone else.",0,,,

I showered today for the first time this week. I still feel like shit,"I think people are meant to regularly bathe. Like we have probably been bathing while still hairy and grunting. I wasn't raised the best; one thing is that I was never taught to bathe regularly. It was normal to bathe once every 2-4 weeks growing up. Basically, I never had it ingrained into me, which led to being super hygienic to the point of irritation and skin problems during puberty, and complete abandonment of hygiene during my intense depressive periods.  So during these periods I would go as long as I could possibly can without showering until it was literally affecting everything I did, usually 4-6 weeks. My dirtiness would get into my eyes, and they would burn like hell. I got more skin problems from the build up of dead skin: in grown hairs, dry scaly skin, acne, etc. My hair had issues too: unhealthy and wiry possibly from an unhealthy scalp and follicles and dandruff. My dick had some infection and itched like hell. I also looked like shit too and was never prepared for events that forced me to go outside which made everything worse (I would hide and wait out people who potentially could see or interact with me, for example). I also was dirty and made my surroundings just as dirty, and I smelled bad, but luckily I don't have volatile BO.  *Anyways*, just saying that there are some serious consequences to poor hygiene that I wish someone told me about.

jobs. does anyone here know any way a freshman can get a job in california. im just hoping that getting a job and earning a little bit of money will help my depression to calm down or not be as severe.,"Freshman in high school or college? If HS, you can get a work permit at 15 I think. You're supposed to have one as long as you're working and under 18. As for finding one at that age most people I know went into food or retail. Coffee shops, fast food, some with cars did pizza delivery. Theaters usually higher younger people. They're simple jobs that don't require a lot of training and younger employees help keep younger crowds coming in. There should be someone at your school like a counselor with info on work permits.  Edit: its also great that you want to work. Having the money can give you more breathing room with bills and you can start building some retirement money. Plus having the experience will help get better jobs. Just remember you don't have to save everything. If all you do is work and your money goes right back out to food/bills/rent/etc, work will become a burden. Put aside a little bit each paycheck as a whatever fund. It wont be much at first but after a few months you'll have a good bit of change set aside. Wanna go for a weekend getaway? Do it. Looking for a new TV. Buy it. I usually set aside $100 month and typically buy something I'd wanted after a few months but couldn't normally justify. Worked out well.

The pain you are feeling is not foolish nor is it you being weak. When we tend to get into relationships we often more time than not replace friendships with our partners. And as time progresses the person is not just simply a partner but a friend whom is apart of the very foundation our life is build upon. I am not sure why you two broke up. And i know it hurts extremely bad, and life has lost much of its meaning. I will it try to come up with some lighthearted crap that tells you everything is going to disappear quickly. This will be tough, this will hurt, and at times it will feel like nothing at all is worth living for. But i must tell you this feeling is temporary..... it will not last forever. How long it will last i cannot say, when it will end i cannot say either. But take it one day at a time. Do things that are only necessary for your existence. And those that are extra if you are not up to it do it. Within the relationship i am sure there were flaws on both parts, beat yourself up about them. When the time is right started to fix those things. And if in months or weeks time you feel like you want to reach out to see if anything can be rekindled do so. But you as a person have to stand alone so if or when this may happen it will not shake your entire life. Become strong from this.",0,,,

Has medical marijuana worked for other peoples depression?. I'm just curious about peoples ideas on the matter.,"It helped at the beginning of my marijuana usage when I was smoking maybe 2-3 times a week but if it can spiral out of control pretty quickly to where it creates a vicious cycle of abuse. The marijuana also blew my anxiety through the roof. In my experience, the depression will come back once not high (and sometimes even worse than it was before getting high) which has the potential for psychological dependence. Within 9 months of beginning self medication I went from smoking like $10 worth 2-3 times a week to 2-3 times a day so beware. By the end of the 9 month period I was spending about $200 a week on weed. Would possibly recommend but i think the best idea for those with addictive/binging personalities because you could end up seriously abusing it during massive depressive episodes.",0,,,

"So the options are either dying in misery or living in misery, either will hurt others and either will be considered ones own fault.

"Yesterday was the worst day of my life, but compared to today, yesterday was good.. This has been my every day for the last years of my life. I needed only one thing to be right in life, so that I could hold on to it. And now that there is nothing, I don't know what to do because I feel I am nothing.","It's a terrible feeling when you try to hold on to even the most minuscule things that bring you any slight amount of joy, and one by one those things get taken from you.  What I try to do is work back on a route to the thing that would lead to getting the one thing that could be right. i.e. something that costs money makes you happy, but you don't make enough money; need a way to make more money; dedicate all free time to applying for better work. Or, feel lonely and haven't got anybody; need to find somebody to stop feeling like that; need to know best places to find somebody; research ways to meet people and put self into that situation. Or feel worthless; being of use to someone or something would make me feel less worthless; dedicate myself to making myself of use to someone who needs somebody; use free time aiding charity or institution where people need you, and you can feel needed.  Honestly, I know it's not that easy a fix, and there will be more bumps to overcome. One of my larger problems is isolation and loneliness, and even having looked at places to go, I still haven't found the courage to put myself into a situation to meet people. But generating a simple starting point where you can do something easily achievable, even just through reading online about how to get started, can make you feel proactive and start to get you into a more productive feeling that maybe it won't be like that forever, and that there is a physical, tangible, mortal way to deal with the situation. So, I would recommend pick a small goal that CAN lead to some form of happiness and work towards that, rather than try to envision this great milestone of achieving happiness in one big leap. Helps you take it day by day a little easier, and I hope that would make each new day, if not better, at least consistent for you. Feel better soon, bud.",0,,,
"Do you know EXACTLY what you need to do to feel better, but it's just so damn hard?. I thought long and hard today and... I guess I always kinda knew the bits and pieces of problems I have, but I pieced them all together today.  My depression started because I was isolated during a school semester (plus hammered with various stress, family and medical). And so.. my self esteem dropped. When I was able to get home, I still felt isolated because being away at school for so long... it felt like I didn't have the same interests as my friends at home anymore. My self esteem continued to drop. I separated from my toxic family, and felt a lot of loss. So... about now, my self esteem is rock bottom. Now it's hard to find connections with people, because I fall into cycles of feeling so negatively about myself. Like a hole I don't have the strength to pull myself out of. I just wish I had someone who could throw me a line, and work with me for a little while until I can get back on my feet! But.. I'm alone. What can I do KNOWING this, but being unable to act on it?

"Why do my friends not care about me?. always been a pretty introverted kid so that means less friends, but recently found out my few friends ever care about had the same friend group for the past 3 years and I always thought we were all pretty good friends but now I feel like they actually care about my well being. It was small things like making fun of me just like friends do but I feel like more than good fun. always small flaws about me as well like drinking soda or doing poorly on a test. I usually do anything to provoke them but I am short tempered so I can get mad at them. They also like ganging up on me so hard to fight their insults.

Need some fucking rest from this bullshit.,"Is there not any thing that makes you feel good? I know that it may not seem like it, but think hard about it. There has to be something in your life, big or small, that makes you feel in a good way. For me I felt like I couldn't have any good emotions. Only bad ones. I sat down one day and really thought about my life. When I'm with my friends I usually can feel good. Most of all my little brothers are what bring me true joy and happiness. I took hold of this and I try to spend time with them the best I can, and sometimes I won't because I'm in a state of self pity, but I'll realize what I'm doing and pull myself out of my bed and spend some time with them. It always helps me. I understand how you feel, but there has to be at least one thing that makes you feel in a non hurtful way.

I really oftenly have intense depressive episodes w/ suicidal thoughts. I want help but I'm too scared to ask,"How old are you? Can you get an appointment with your primary doctor? Even a regular doctor can help you if you just talk to them. They can get you to the right place.  I went through the same thing trying to tell my doctor something was wrong. It turned out he asked me. Sometimes they'll ask a generic have you been feeling down or helpless, have you had any suicidal thoughts etc. I think they're getting better at making it easier to talk about.  It's worth a shot.
