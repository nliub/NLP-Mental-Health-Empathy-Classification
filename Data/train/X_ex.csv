How to stop caring. I'm not even sure what thread to put this on. I just need someone to tell me how to stop caring about shit that I don't need to obsess over because it's killing me. If something bothers me how do I make it stop eating away at my brain?,"The Power of Now literally saved my soul. I over analyzed every fucking thing and it was making me so, so miserable. I read it in a really bad period, and for the first time in a long time I felt really good again for a couple of hours. When those couple of hours came and went and I started to feel crappy again - I read the book again. It's not a big book, took about an hour and a half to read. I carried it everywhere with me for the next few weeks and whenever I could feel myself getting low, I'd read it again when I had the chance. I found over time the low moods became less and less. I also deactivated all my social media accounts while I could get my head around it all. I started buying more books on mindfulness and regularly read them. Besides understanding the present moment, it also helped me figure out my issues. Like, the root cause of my issues. As soon as I started to accept and own my feelings and the reasons I was analysing everything, it lifted a massive weight. I'm not saying it's a fix for everyone, but it sure as hell is worth a try.",0,,,

"What's the point?. Why am I supposed to stay alive? I don't want to reproduce and I don't care for anyone in my life.

The way I see it is that we're here to give our life meaning one way or another. Since we don't know the meaning we have to make the meaning. Some people find that through their work, family, helping others, etc. Life is full of endless possibilities of what we can do with it. It's hard getting to the point where we feel like we're happy or accomplished but that in itself is another aspect of life and finding meaning. For some people it could take most of their lives to find the meaning that they were looking for and in my view I'd rather spend my whole life looking for that meaning and helping who I can along the way than to just accept that there's no meaning to it and end it since that's not really an answer. I may never get the answer myself but I can at least enjoy the journey leading to the end and maybe that in and of itself was the meaning all along. You'll meet many varieties of people throughout your life who will give you different perspectives of what meaning is to them and maybe that will help you on your journey and maybe it won't. We have the time we're given and what we do with it is dependent on us. Even after we die and join the rest of the universe in it's infinite there'll still be people around who will say, Hey remember u/OkayScience, I want to do what he did and live my life to its fullest. We can still be remembered for the life we lived even after we're gone and in that way we'll essentially live forever. This is the way I see life and it helps me from time to time. I still have my bad days and sometimes consider if it's all worth it but then I just keep going because I won't know if I just stop here. Plus it helps talking to people about it at times and if you do feel like talking about it more feel free to send me a message. Keep going with the journey and stay strong since you'll find your meaning in time.",0,,,

I feel like I'm too mentally ill to be loved. I just feel like if someone ever wanted me they'd walk away from me because of my anxiety and depression. I feel like I'd scare them off and they'd be incapable of loving me.,"your illness does not make you any less deserving of love, nor any harder to love. can it make you harder to deal with? yes. and not everyone will be able to deal with it, and you can never ask anyone to. but someone who cannot deal with it is not right for you. i am one of the people who choose to deal with it, my bf is severely depressed and has anxiety. i don't love him any less for it, he was already suffering from it when i met him and i still saw right through it, saw who he was. (kind and excitable and loving) when you're suffering, first and foremost what you need is to get better. being loved, by family or friends or a partner, is part of that. having a partner is not essential, though. i can talk about this for hours if you want me to, but it's important for any relationship you have to be healthy and not turn toxic. you are not a burden, you are not unlovable. at this point in your life people who you have close relations with have to be able to understand and support you. and you deserve that, and those people exist. it can be hard to imagine, when people are depressed their life is usually not in a state where they're very connected to like-minded people. but anything can happen, and things can change. and even without change, you can encounter great things. i can tell you about my experience if you ever want.",0,,,

jobs. does anyone here know any way a freshman can get a job in california. im just hoping that getting a job and earning a little bit of money will help my depression to calm down or not be as severe.,"Freshman in high school or college? If HS, you can get a work permit at 15 I think. You're supposed to have one as long as you're working and under 18. As for finding one at that age most people I know went into food or retail. Coffee shops, fast food, some with cars did pizza delivery. Theaters usually higher younger people. They're simple jobs that don't require a lot of training and younger employees help keep younger crowds coming in. There should be someone at your school like a counselor with info on work permits.  Edit: its also great that you want to work. Having the money can give you more breathing room with bills and you can start building some retirement money. Plus having the experience will help get better jobs. Just remember you don't have to save everything. If all you do is work and your money goes right back out to food/bills/rent/etc, work will become a burden. Put aside a little bit each paycheck as a whatever fund. It wont be much at first but after a few months you'll have a good bit of change set aside. Wanna go for a weekend getaway? Do it. Looking for a new TV. Buy it. I usually set aside $100 month and typically buy something I'd wanted after a few months but couldn't normally justify. Worked out well. I still had some other money to go out to eat or do things, but I got a big reward every few months.",0,Freshman in high school or college?|,Freshman in high school or college?,Freshman in high school or college?

How do some people get so lucky?. How do some people get lucky enough they don't get depressed and seem to live active healthy happy lives? It's like a curse of chance your either lucky enough to not have it come down on your or your one of the unfortunate ones to have it happen.,"I think it's a matter of perspective. Bad things happen to everyone, but how you react makes a difference. I don't see the point of complaining. If I'm upset or feel like I've been dealt a bad hand, I look for a solution. In the past, I used to beat myself up over all my screw ups or when I felt I wasn't treated right. I realize now that everyone goes through the same type of things and you can't fight them. Adults have the same issues with heartbreak and money trouble as teens, the only difference is they think they're experienced. No one is experienced. Everything that happens to you is the first time that unique situation happened to your unique person. Your reaction is the only thing that changes how these events affect you. I know it's generalizing a bit, but if only good things happen to happy people, it's because those people tend to focus on the good things that happen to them and view the bad things that happen as an obstacle that they need to overcome. They don't wallow. Having confidence that you will overcome these negative events helps portray the happy personality.",0,,,

Is anyone else incredibly funny irl but miserable af when they get home?. What kind of jokes do you do? Who knows what you really feel inside? Why do we rely on other people's happiness?,"It's fucking weird.  I often have to bring every ounce of willpower up to bring myself to go to a party with frends, even though I know it will be good.  But once I'm there, I'm often the Life of the Party, or so I think. I had people coming up to me, greeting me by my name and telling me how much fun they had last time we had met each other. Which was a year ago. For the first and last time since. I barely remembered their faces and not a single name. So I guess I left an impression.  I really like to banter, to do play on words and take words from their mouth and turn them around in a fun way. I joke and tell stories with expressive facial expressions and big gestures. I'm sarcastic, sometimes even cynical. And I joke a lot about myself, mostly in a non-flattering way.  I think people like me in general, I seldomly had someone outright refuse to interact with me.  But on the other hand, as soon as I come home, I feel a crushing void and I feel alone and that everything is pointless. Those feelings remain in my day-to-day life. And it starts to interfere with my work, for example. I am not one to contain my feelings in an enviroment where I spend most of my days and life in. My boss already told me once, in a pretty long phase of being really depressed, that even my collegues said that something must be seriously wrong and the have no fun working around and with me if I'm in such mood.  I can be fun at work, too. I made my co-workers laugh on a lot f different occasions. But that happens in good phases. But there are very bad phases where I, at best, don't say a single word all day unless absolutly necessary and at worst, I am filled with rage the whole day and can't contain it.

This includes: website testing, taking surveys, data entry, transcription, virtual assistant, and so on.  Can I suggest you something? It's a process to recover from your depression.  1. The first thing you should do is to find out the top three things, basically your skills that you are good at and which can help you in some way for getting online jobs. 2. Make a list of such jobs that you can opt for as per your top three skill-sets. 3. The next thing is to look for free or paid online resources to learn about that job and start applying.  I would suggest starting with some easy job that you can find without any trouble. For instance, you can do data entry in the beginning. After a few months, you can start doing transcription work, and then maybe move on to become a virtual assistant. So in this way, you will ultimately start earning a decent earning on your own.  I hope this may help you. All the best!",0,,,

The term fetishizing is used in a harsh, accusatory, pejorative way, blaming the characters for perpetually watching their lives through the blackest prism, but the truth is they just do not know any better than to do so. Furthermore, fetishes are often believed to be shameful and obscene in nature, because such random, nonsexual items PRODUCE intense satisfaction, whereas people that are accused of fetishizing sadness are just sheltering themselves (if i fuck myself up, no one else will).",0,,,

Has medical marijuana worked for other peoples depression?. I'm just curious about peoples ideas on the matter.,"It helped at the beginning of my marijuana usage when I was smoking maybe 2-3 times a week but if it can spiral out of control pretty quickly to where it creates a vicious cycle of abuse. The marijuana also blew my anxiety through the roof. In my experience, the depression will come back once not high (and sometimes even worse than it was before getting high) which has the potential for psychological dependence. Within 9 months of beginning self medication I went from smoking like $10 worth 2-3 times a week to 2-3 times a day so beware. By the end of the 9 month period I was spending about $200 a week on weed. Would possibly recommend but i think the best idea for those with addictive/binging personalities because you could end up seriously abusing it during massive depressive episodes.",0,,,

Like if you are really into something, say cars, than if you have a car and go to car meets or race, others will see this and know that you're the guy to know if they want to get into a car scene.  Another example would be if you are really into books and people feel like reading something and know that you are into books, they might come to you for recommendations.

It was small things like making fun of me just like friends do but I feel like more than good fun. always small flaws about me as well like drinking soda or doing poorly on a test. I usually do anything to provoke them but I am short tempered so I can get mad at them. They also like ganging up on me so hard to fight their insults.

I feel so misunderstood. Why nobody seems to understand in pain and what going through? Living is not that easy :( I think I kinda wanna die ...,"Hi friend! :) I'm really sorry you're in such pain :( sometimes the people we have around us can't see the pain we're in because they don't want to (they may see it, not know how to help us, and are afraid to because it may cause them pain).  This may seem like useless advice, but it can greatly help if you tell the other people exactly how you're feeling and ask them to try and help you. Nobody will ever be inside your head and able to experience exactly what you are feeling, but by talking to them and letting them know, you can help them to understand you. Sometimes we have to do the hardest part of reaching out ourselves. I had to tell my best friend I was feeling suicidal, but by telling her she helped me turn my life around. She just didn't realise. It's never easy to do, but I can promise you that you are so much stronger than you know, and there are always people willing to listen and to try to understand what you're going through.  Lastly, I hope you don't die. Not until you've been able to live the life that you want, the life that you deserve to have. I'm sending you love and luck.",0,,,
