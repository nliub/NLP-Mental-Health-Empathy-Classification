I talked to my doctor a couple years ago and basically I learned that depression is a *mental illness* and you can literally have no reason to be depressed, like myself, and still feel like absolute shit and want to cry all the time. I'm pretty sure we were just born with it and you can only treat it. I myself am still trying to fight it but It's only been maybe like 8 years so I'm sure it will get better eventually.|","I feel the same way. At least I did for a while.

We recently talked after a few months of NC and her getting leveled out on anti-depressants. Her hurt was not the same as mine. Her emotions were flat-lined. Anhedonia. The sadness, anger, frustration, confusion, despair that I felt are emotions she was incapable of feeling. I know this because I was severely depressed myself years ago. Even now since she is on SSRI's, and with it being months later, I don't think her hurt is even close to what mine was. I think her hurt is more in regret. I honestly doubt she will ever truly hurt over this breakup - by the time she's off the meds and capable of feeling those raw emotions again, it will probably be a total of 1-2 years since the breakup. She'll only have to deal with regret - if even that. Of course some cynical side of me wants her to feel what I did. I want her to grieve the loss of our relationship like I did. I want her to think about what we had, let those good memories fill her with the positive emotions we had together, and have them followed up by sadness over the realization she lost it. But when I really think about it, I know I don't want that to happen. She cried enough when she started sinking lower into depression. The outbursts, the frustration, the fear of losing me. I remember how much that happened. She hurt too, it just happened for months before the breakup, where mine was after.|","My ex broke up with me because of hers.

The marijuana also blew my anxiety through the roof. In my experience, the depression will come back once not high (and sometimes even worse than it was before getting high) which has the potential for psychological dependence.

A couple years later, I could handle that, but I cried when I got cut from the basketball team. A couple years after that, I was nearly suicidal when my girlfriend dumped me. I eventually learned to handle rejection, but full time work drove me to drug abuse. Now, I can handle working 50 hours a week. The point is I have always had terrible coping skills. None of my problems have ever been that bad, but they have been the biggest problem I ever faced.

I thought that if I could go through physical pain, then I can go through mental pain. A physical scar is easier to understand that an emotional one. Having to tend to my wounds to stop the bleeding and cover them up distracted me from what I really wanted to tend to and cover up. There was a couple times where I self harmed because my thoughts were too overwhelming while I was trying to fall asleep. Afterwards, I would spend some time in the bathroom alone, taking care of my bleeding and by the time it was all finished, I forgot what I was thinking about. Self harm was an effort to try and beat life at its own game. If life was beating me up, maybe if I did a better job at that than life then maybe the punches life throws at me seem so bad. since moved on from this.

Stupidly stopped taking them and I just got more and more detached from reality. Combined with my very mild ASD I never really got to have much interaction with other kids outside of school, never even really had friends I would talk to during the day. I never learned how to be an adult when it comes to relationships (of all kinds). Because society just developed that way, I guess. Everybody is on their damn phones. God forbid you want to ... *gasp* ... walk up and say hi to someone on the street. I went to university last year and it was a bit better, and liberating, but I still had big trouble connecting with anyone. I made one good friend (my roommate) and met a couple people on Tinder, I tried to go to school clubs and be proactive and not feel sorry for myself. But I just can't connect with anyone unless they are literally forced to be in a room with me, apparently. When I go back I will try to smile more. That's what everyone keeps telling me. To answer your question, I don't think I am depressed because of how we live. I'm depressed because of what essentially amounts to bad luck. But it sure as hell makes my life a lot harder. At the same time, we are lucky to live the comfortable lives we do nowadays.

1,0,I'm locked in a viscous cycle between my physical and mental illnesses. Been diagnosed with major depressive disorder for close to 5 years now. About 2 years ago I developed a movement disorder. It has been documented but not yet diagnosed as doctors haven't figured out anything about it. The depression triggers the non epileptic seizures which cause major disturbances in my life. Crippling my quality of life and reducing what I can do. This feeds into my depression. More negative mental health the worse and more frequent the seizure like symptoms happen. Also have bad tremors and ticks in relation to the non epileptic seizures. I often fall down and have issues walking and standing. Can barely leave my home. Am reduces to limit movement inside my home which has caused weight gain from decrease movements which also stregnthens my depression which in return causes more seizure like episodes. No medication helps my mental or physical health. It actually worsens both. I am going without treatment because doctors refuse to take it seriously or are completely dumbfounded. It has been over a year since anything was prescribed to attempt to help me. Seen several specialist. This terrible cycle has lead me to multiple suicide attempts in the last few months.|,I'm locked in a viscous cycle between my physical and mental illnesses.
