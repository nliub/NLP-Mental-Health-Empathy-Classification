My crush just told me she cant love but i would be her first choice and its killing me inside.

I've just spent the entire day in bed. It feels wrong to think I've had a bad day.,"Hey, is there something that's overwhelming you, or something that you are avoiding? What is going on? Why are you in bed? Sometimes when you share it can help to lighten the burden.",0,,,
"I'm pathetic. If I see girls or anything about couples or marriage, I get super sad and feel like crying. My depression is just getting worse day by day.","Hey, I feel the same way. quite demoralizing to see everyone in a relationship when all you want at times. Most of my friends are in committed relationships. So, been times where I was the only single guy in the room. I say anything, but deep down it kind of hurts. I help but think I just I realize that not something I could say to anyone else. I could never look at anyone call them unlovable. So why can I say it myself? Why do we think such nasty thoughts about ourselves? My friend, you do deserve love, and I hope that it comes to you. :) Oh, and social media is terrible for this type of feeling btw. been staying off Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat lately. I now feel a lot more secure in my status as not constantly bombarded with pictures of happy couples (who are also usually just posing for the picture, sometimes they break up the next day).",0,"My friend, you do deserve love, and I hope that it comes to you.|","My friend, you do deserve love, and I hope that it comes to you.","My friend, you do deserve love, and I hope that it comes to you."
Is there a difference between compassion and pity? Can I get better at recognizing it?. I hate opening up to people because I am afraid they'll throw a pity party for me. I don't want to be pitied; I want to be understood. But it seems like everyone's first response is pity. It makes me feel like a burden to them.,At least it's something. Would you rather have them pity you or not give a shit? I feel alone with everyone I'm around. I think it'd be worse knowing I'm truly alone.

"I constantly feel morally and intellectually superior to everyone around me, but with no evidence to back up these feelings.. Like, I'll look around me as I sit in lectures or walk around the university campus and think to myself these people are just so stupid, they understand nothing, they're so shallow and empty-headed, and I feel 100% confident in being right, but then I'll try to logically think about why I'm superior (and I'm also 100% certain that I *am* superior), and I come up with nothing. In any quantifiable measure of superiority, I always fail. And yet, I can't shake this feeling that everyone else is inferior to me. I think maybe it's just a gut reaction because of how unhappy and depressed I am, but I don't know. I know that I probably sound like a complete asshole to anyone reading this, but it's how I honestly feel.","Maybe it's a defense mechanism you created when you were a child?

Flopping on social medias can be kinda depressing. I have 30 Instagram followers. How to get more?,"Why is that depressing? You should not let the amount of followers determine how you feel, especially not to this extent. It is not a reflection of what you are worth nor how successful your life is. Even if you would get more followers, what would this solve? You would not even know who most of those people are. I also doubt that an illusion like this could provide anyone with actual happiness. And Instagram has a pretty messed up algorithm anyway, I would personally not even bother.",0,,,

"i need to bleed. which area is the most painful yet least dangerous to cut? i can handle physical pain, but i need this emotional anguish to go away.","Cutting the topside of my arms hurt and bled but they clotted pretty quickly. Please use a sterile blade if you're going to cut yourself, and don't go any deeper than just the surface skin. Take it from me as someone who has used self-harm, an infection is not the sort of pain that helps with emotional relief! I also recommend other methods, there are plenty out there that can cause some pretty gnarly pain but are far, far safer than cutting. Are there any taps in your house that have overly hot water? Boiling water shouldn't be used as it will scald and is just as prone to infection and other nasties as cutting, so just try clenching a fist under the regular hot water for a few seconds. On the other end of the scale I found the grabing an ice cube and squeezing as tight as I could helped! I thought it would just make my hand feel numb, but it creates a localised, sharp unbearable sensation that works wonders to distract me.",0,,,

"Do you ever question the point of your life?. I do this a lot. I've asked myself the same question a million times already.

It sounds like trying to work backwards from what you think makes other lives worth living, what you think validates their lives. But a vexed approach. Those things may enrich a experience and situations, but they confer meaning and significance in and of a cart before the horse thing. We get value from lists of attributes, you just plug in these arbitrary conditions and get a happy human that lives an engaging life. And, more importantly, you fixate on those attributes and dream that those magical little things are what stand between you and your sense of fulfillment and worth.

How could I be happy if nobody is happy with me?. And why would I want to live on?,"Hi there, you know that is a very good question and I used to have similar thoughts as you. I now have a question to ask you, why would other be happy with you when you are not happy with yourself? The thing is, we need to develop self love and self care first. Because without it, we will be too dependent on others and that becomes burdensome because no one's life is perfect and they all have their own issues to deal with. Even though other people wants to love you and support you, they can only do it to a certain extent. The rest of the void that you have inside of you can only be filled by yourself. I know you don't feel it but being able to learn to self love is the key to happiness because that is when you feel like your life is in your control again, not on others. I would recommend you to google how to self love or seek therapy to talk this over and find out what your root cause is.

How did you (If you did) beat depression?. I'm curious to know how y'all did it.,"I watched a short video once (I'm sure can google but I'm on phone and about to get in car) that compared depression to a big black dog. On bad days the dog is giant and weighing you down and on better days the dog is small and at your feet. This helped me accept a lot more about my life and my depression rather than constantly wishing it could just go away. I would get so mad at myself for being angry/sad but now I know it's like owning an animal--you take care of it and it won't bite you, at least not as much anyway. It's part of who you are and that is okay. I do not have severe depression so I am not on meds, so can't speak for those folks who are, but for me exercise and doing things for me (rather than constantly for others or other people's approval) really helped. It's like learning to be selfish in a good way. Eating less carbs and gluten helped too as they tended to make my body more sluggish which did t help when I already felt sad/slow/tired. I eat a lot more protein and fresh veggies now and I think there is a big difference--especially after 6+ months. I still drink alcohol but now a limited variety of stuff that I truly like the flavor of rather than eh it's here so I'll drink it. Also I don't drink when I'm in a bad place or anything traumatic happened that day/week. It's just a recipe for bad. I don't do any other drugs and I'm allergic to smoke so can't speak on that. I also drink 0 caffeine but that's mostly due to stomach issues--not sure if that would help or not. Good luck!",0,,,

I just sort of always felt sad, or at most neutral, but I had a good job, finished school, and an active social life. It was the little invisible things that nobody ever saw. Staying in bed awake for hours on weekdays, intentionally isolating myself or lying so I could be alone and mope. I stopped exercising and gained a ton of weight. Hell I even had suicidal ideation and I just thought it was normal. I want to kill myself but I stop thinking about death and me dying. It sometimes felt like if I stopped existing it would be fine. I knew something was wrong but I was adamant it depression. Then I went to my doctor thinking I had an anxiety problem and he began to ask THE questions. I knew he was trying to see if I had depression and it caught me by surprise. Of course I lied for most of them. It would be embarrassing; there was no way I was depressed, but the thought had worked its way in. Over the course of a year I did some idle research. I realized suicidal thoughts and a fascination with death are not normal. I matched a lot of my behavior to symptoms of depression. I came to accept it. All said I was depressed for 3+ years before I realized it.",0,,,

My mom and dad both did that to me for a while. I'm 16. I used to be depressed over my bad grades and I had this constant anxious feeling that my life was over because of these bad grades and I would amount to nothing. Then all of a sudden one day, I noticed that bad grades in high school aren't the end of the world. It might have been because I moved out of my Dad's place and I didn't have to hear him call me a failure anymore. Either way, I became happy again. Then I met her. A nice girl who was my age. She had a pretty face, we had a ton of classes together, and she thought I was really funny. I was able to open up to her. I think (I know) I fell in love with her. She had a boyfriend though. He's a shitty person. He's high all the time and he always flirts around with other girls. I really thought she would break it off with him and find her way to my arms and I'd be the happiest guy in the world. That didn't happen. I became desperate. I began to have a drinking problem because of it. One night while very drunk I texted her a bunch of things about my depression. I don't think she cares about me anymore. Now I find myself drunk and alone for the umpteenth time wondering how I let myself get depressed again.  Basically what I wanna say to you is: your life's not over, it's just beginning.

If there was truly a god as religion describes it would do everything in its power to help its creation..

Not for adhd. I would ask your doctor about vyvance or another drug similar to that for your adhd... mirtazapine is perfectly fine to go from that dose to 30 in my opinion. It would be better if your body was introduced longer to the 15mg (2weeks) then bumped up to 30mg, but I see no complications or issues with being bumped up to 30mg this early in the game. Side effects of Mirtazapine are that it will make you tired, so the motivation and everything may be an issue with your adhd... Again look into vyvance. You may gain some weight also, that is a common side effect. Also some anxiety could occur, but that is rare. important to read up on your meds when you receive new ones. Or ask your doctor before you even get prescribed them.",0,,,

"Post-suicide Questions I Wanted to Ask. I started writing my letters today and I wondered how people would receive them if they were electronic. These letters arent really something I can handwrite in a timely manner without having the courage to keep writing. Do the police access the computer and shift through the belongings to find the letters or wouls I have to send them out myself to have them delivered? What happens to my belongings? If I lock myself in a nonshared dorm room and kill myself, how long would it take to find my body and who would be responsible for cleaning it up? Would it leave my family in debt? Would blowing my head off or hanging myself leave my body in a state where it's unusable for a funeral? I'm turning 20 in 2 months and I'm just too tired. Id like to finally be able to rest and not have to live a conitant life of fear and sadness. As much as I do not want to keep living this kind of life, I am too tired to keep pushing through any longer and I'd just like for my death to be somewhat feasible for my mom and sibling.","the thing, though, your death be feasible. Your mom and sibling would spend the rest of their lives wondering if it was something they did or said that pushed you over the edge, or thinking about what they could have done differently to be there for you. One of both of them would likely spiral into a depression of their own. I used to think that no one would miss me much if I killed myself, but always remember the sound of my brothers voice when he found me with blood pouring from my arm. That something that you can just get over. Even leaving notes really help the pain for your family. Also consider the suffering of the people who found you. It could be an RA or a dorm mate. They would be traumatized for life, with severe PTSD from seeing a dead, decomposing body. That point would be too late for you to do anything, so we try not to let it go that far. get me wrong, I know where coming from, and not trying to make you feel bad for would be wrong. And clear from the fact that even thinking about these things that you have some reservations, so build on that. Take every little good thing that happens to you and imagine never feeling that way again, and imagine robbing the people you love of those feelings as well. Forgive me for being brash, but there is absolutely nothing delicate or glorious about suicide. The people who experience it secondhand go through ten times the suffering of the people who commit it.

"Self help without professional treatment. Hi, I believe that I may have major depressive disorder. I am going into college this coming fall and do not have the funds or time to seek professional help since school is coming so soon. What can I do to improve my life for the time being? Every day I face a lack of motivation, feelings of hopelessness, general sadness, and overall lethargy and laziness. Nothing I do motivates me and every time I try and do something I give up halfway through and never return to what I was doing.","I would say plan around your depression. You gotta give yourself more time to do stuff because there will be days where you just do work. If on average you give yourself 2 weeks to do a paper, give yourself 3 weeks and push yourself to work when you have good days. Know that going to be tiring to try to work as soon as your depression temporarily lifts and just take things in small increments. Write a paragraph a day for 3 weeks and or write two paragraphs when you miss a day due to depression and voila! Same results, different pace, depression included and worked around. Practice self care and indulge in the fee things that make you feel okay. stay in your dorm/apartment constantly. Seriously, even if you go to the library for a few hours a day, it helps with isolation. If you like to write, start roleplays with people on geeking or rolemance and reply when you need a break from academic writing. Otherwise indulge in low energy hobbies. And try to eat 2 meals a day even when you feel like it. It makes a difference. Overall, the transition is going to be rough and even more rough for you because of depression so try not to get stuck in a loop of bad habits.

And if it feels like the end of the world why it actually end?,"Sometimes, when something happens in the moment, we see it as this huge thing because it is the center of our focus.

People often ask me why I don't worry about these seemingly huge problems in my life. Well, it's not that I don't worry, because I do. That's just being human, but I constantly remind myself that things usually just work out, and I just need to run the course that I see in front of me.

When you have to stay alive for someone else.

Being terminally ill for the past 7 years (Im 42 now) the physical pain of a slow and horrible illness has led to my depression and desire to die. It is up to my wife though. And for her I live every day in hell. When you have even one person to keep you going, it can be enough. I am a lurker here and I read posts to give me perspective. Rarely can I physically reply. But what my experience being bound to a bed 24/7 has taught me is that once I made my peace with dying, I became indifferent to everything. For myself It's been tough to see people truly depressed to the point of wanting to die. I am very empathetic, but my depression is a symptom so its hard to understand. The one thing I do understand though is that the last thing you want to hear is Don't do it!!! Call this number... or other similar programmed/indoctrinated responses. So just know this... The world and life can be one big shitshow... So it helps to keep toilet paper handy. Let your friend be your toilet paper and be your friends toilet paper. It will be enough.  Lastly... Just remember that no matter how bad life feels (and is...) even I am artificially grateful for the fact that I have a far better life right now (suffering from *pain and bound to a bed), than 99.999999% of all humans to have ever lived. Just try to make it as long as you can. Know how much worse it can be. And let your toilet paper know that you need them to help clean up some shit. Then when you are ready to go.... You will know. But I cant see it happening for you as long as you remain attached to someone that you can call a friend. So give yourself a list of requirements that must be met for you to end it all. *- Pain so severe that causes me to vomit my own feces at times as it sends my body into shock. I wish you the best. I hope you can suffer less in time if possible. You and I are here right now... That makes us stronger than those who gave up yesterday.

It helps me knowing that maybe I will have something that can give a healthy, long, and amazing life for a person who is still able to live it. ) Just think about making the list... And go tell your friend, right now, that you love him/her... Even if they are not quilted and only 1-ply thickness. You both need that right now... The whole world needs that right now.

"Sometimes I wonder if I really even have depression. I was diagnosed 2 or 3 years ago by my family doctor, who prescribed SSRIs \(which I never took\). My moods range from suicidal and self harming to just feeling out of sorts and not at peace with myself. Sometimes I go months without feeling like that, sometimes it seems to come about every few weeks and lasts for weeks at a time. I don't know, I sometimes compare myself to my boyfriend who has a team of psychologists and psychiatrists working to diagnose him, whereas I just went to my family doctor, filled in a questionnaire, and boom got labelled with depression. I wonder if I'm faking it or blowing my feelings out of proportion, especially comparing it to more serious cases of mental illness. Does anyone else ever feel this way? How do you deal with it?","Just because you don't or can't have access to that level of mental health care does not mean your own mental illness is any less valid. I have always had a team, a prescribing doctor, therapist, and GP. Sometimes specifically a team that works together, sometimes just doctor's that kind of share notes but don't ever meet up. I am very lucky. Very few people get this level of treatment. Any number of genuine suicidal thoughts is too many. Everyone gets depressed, but when you stay there long enough to consider life actually painful to live you have depression. It can be really hard not to play mental illness Olympics. But someone else struggling more does not take away from your own struggle. Your feelings, your illness, are real. They're valid. They have NOTHING to do with anyone else's struggles.

If you are worried about coping, you can take things slowly, step by step. I should follow my own advice here as well: don't be afraid to seek therapy if you can. It will help, even if it only helps a little. As for your job, I'm sorry it didn't work out. But don't let things ruminate in your mind. Worrying about them over and over does nothing to help you. *Depression thrives in rumination*. Try looking into mindfulness meditation. It's not spiritual garbage, it's literally training the neural pathways in your brain to put less weight on particular thoughts, so that you don't get stuck in negative feedback loops. It takes time to change your brain structure, but it can be done. Another thing is to find distractions. Productive is better, but if you keep the less productive ones in check they can be helpful also. Delve into hobbies or learn a new skill. Be social and try new things. That's the best way to cope in my opinion. I need to take my own advice.",0,I'm sorry it didn't work out|,I'm sorry it didn't work out,I'm sorry it didn't work out

"Cyclothymia. I have just been diagnosed with cyclothymia and am terrified because changing my meds. My meds been working the greatest, but so scared to switch them up. Does anyone else have experience with cyclothymia? just now for the first time in my life recognizing the symptoms I have.","I was diagnosed with it when I was 15, and I am 22 now. For my antidepressant, I tried lexapro ( which i stopped taking; because, it made my dick stop working), and wellbutrin.. which was alright. My antipsychotic was risperidone.. which I honestly am still dealing with a side affect of it till this day. I'll be honest, I took those combination of drugs for like 2.5 years, and just stopped. I learned how to deal with the symptoms a lot better than I did from years prior.. looking back.. thst could've gone poorly. I'd recommend being open in discussion with your psychiatrist about the effects these drugs are having on your body and your mood. There are quite a few drug combinations for this type of diagnosis, and it would be wise to work dilligently with your psychiatrist until you find the combination for you. Don't be afraid of them changing your meds. They aren't work anyway, so you may as well be open to working with professionals to find something that works for you and your body. I'd also recommend to try being aware as possible if the symptoms, the triggers for those symptoms, and look to grow from them even while on these medications. Keep a close eye out for unwanted side effects. A lot of the medicines they may try to prescribe would require regular schedules blood work. I'll be honest, I did the irresponsible thing and ended up just not taking them. I got tired of taking medicine at that point; because, I had been taking it all my life. Whether it was for childhood epilepsy, ADHD, depression, and the last diagnosis cyclothymia. Was hospitalized twice before I got the cyclothymia diagnosis, and it was pretty bad at one point, and looking back.. I'm really lucky I didn't mess myself up by just stopping cold turkey.

My family doesn't seem to understand how bad my pain is. My dad understood it when he saw me limping due to pain in my legs. But my mom and the rest of the family always trivializes it. They call me lazy when I try to take rest in bed . She won't understand no matter how many times I explain it.","I'm so sorry to hear about your situation--that's a really difficult thing to have to endure, especially with your family's lack of understanding. I don't think you should give up the possibility of finding relief for your pain--even if there is not a reliable treatment now, pain relief is a major area of medical science research. (Is medical marijuana legal where you live, or if not is it a possibility to move to where it is?) You might find support and recommendations at r/sciatica Hang in there. I would strongly recommend trying to talk to a therapist if that's an option.

Don't get sucked in is my advice. You'll get nothing good out of it. The thing with alcohol is that, once you start drinking too much, too often, the idea that it makes you feel better is entertained while it is not true at all. It's: *I drink to forget, but I've drank so much I don't know what it is I have to forget. So I drink, just to be sure.* Alcohol and drugs have become a habit for me and I can't really live without them anymore. I need them to maintain a level of tolerable shittiness - but trust me, I'd be way less miserable if I never started it.",0,,,

I can't let go, it has gotten worse with unfortunate life events(lost the opportunity of a life time that will never be recovered). I just can't stop wanting change, change that doesn't exist in this world. Therapy didn't work, meds are uncertain because studies keep pointing towards how bad or ineffective they are and I don't want to risk it for the long term anyways, meditation helped a bit but it will never fill this void that I have.

I would say that MAYBE, if I gave advice on it, it would be that I used to have a similar thing with shyness, and with that I pushed myself into more and more social situations and now am not so shy. It MAYBE might work the same way with liking/disliking social interaction. But I do that everyday and I still don't like people. I'm more COMFORTABLE around them, but I still don't LIKE them.

Instead, you rolled it out like a sales pitch for snake oil.

If it doesn't work and somebody spirals down and harms themselves or worse, even in one single instance, you are at least partially to blame for selling them that false hope.

"College graduates/current college students:. How have you gotten through difficult parts of your school year when your depression is severely effecting your academic work? Going through a difficult path this semester and tanked two exams this week already, really looking for some advice to improve.","Yes, I have. Currently I am a mess. Nevertheless there used to be a time when I was a mess, but still had a reason to pick myself up and get my shit done. If you want to study and pass your exams, this is what I did: - Get busy studying now (within 15 minutes). No excuses to eat/drink a bit. Not going to the bathroom. Just study. Phone away. If possible laptop/computer away. Do this for at least one hour and take a small break to get fresh air if you want and drink some water. NO PHONE. Then back to studying. Again one hour or more. - After studying go for a run (I don't care if it is 11 pm) or exercise in some other way. - Eat healthy. You crave good tasting food? chocolate? chips? No go. When you go to the supermarket, fast food is not an option. You will not spend your money on that shit. No chips, no sweet stuff, no special drinks. Fruit/vegetables/carbs/meat/fish/bread/milk/yoghurt. Healthy stuff. Lots of water. - Go to bed on time. Get out of bed on time. - No thinking! Only actions. - Do one thing at a time. No thinking about tomorrow or the next hours. Just about the next minute. What are you going to do now? Shower? check. Dress? check. Breakfast? check. Go to library? check. Study one hour? check. Have a small break and drink water? check. continue. - If possible, study with other people - (added) When I get stuck, it has been VERY helpful for me to discuss this with other students. This has been very difficult for me, because I have a crazy amount of pride and am very ashamed of showing I do not understand something. Nonetheless, it has helped me so much to just discuss a problem where i got stuck with someone and then see the light which enables me to continue studying (instead of procrastinating till everything went to shit). This doesn't solve the deeper problems, but it probably will get you through your exams as good as possible. At least, this is how I managed to finish my undergraduate years. Not healthy, but it worked. Also you will probably find that by being so hard for yourself, setting boundaries and actually following them, you will start to feel a lot better about yourself and gain confidence. This is a trap, do not get satisfied with yourself. Being satisfied and giving yourself more space to slightly cross your boundaries again is equal to getting on the slide that will get you right back into the pit. This became a rant, hope it helps you in some way.",0,,,

Work out a plan for each class on how to raise grades, maybe see if you can stay before or after school with one of them to have them monitor you while you work.

In my case, I used constant denial and self-numbing ... At some point, I just assumed the pit was a part of me I could choose to ignore. You seem to be actively trying to experience it. You are engaging your sadness, which is objectively good for working through depression. It may not be what you might call 'conventional' but everyone does their thing a little differently :) If what you are doing no longer works for you though, it might be best to start looking for other (healthy) ways of working through that discomfort. Personally, when I feel that pit, I know what thoughts tend to follow it. Fortunately, my therapists (and my stay at hospital) helped me come up with ways to attack that pit when it hit me hard. In order to redirect those thoughts that create it, I try to reach out to anyone in my support net. It's hard because I feel like they won't give a shit, but most of the time, they do (but I often choose to ignore that reality). Or I will simply write some positive words here, on this. Reaching out to others here in positive ways is not just for others, but for my own sake as well. As you put so well, giving that pit a 'purpose'. But don't cover that feeling up. Continue to engage with it, as best as you can. It's there for a reason.

Is having friends really this important?. There's always people saying life is nothing without friends or stuff like that. As someone who isn't even trying to look for a friend this is quite sad.

Letting depression take over your life and making it utterly worthless is easier than fighting it.. Realized that now.

"Yesterday was the worst day of my life, but compared to today, yesterday was good.. This has been my every day for the last years of my life. I needed only one thing to be right in life, so that I could hold on to it. And now that there is nothing, I don't know what to do because I feel I am nothing.","It's a terrible feeling when you try to hold on to even the most minuscule things that bring you any slight amount of joy, and one by one those things get taken from you. What I try to do is work back on a route to the thing that would lead to getting the one thing that could be right. i.e. something that costs money makes you happy, but you don't make enough money; need a way to make more money; dedicate all free time to applying for better work. Or, feel lonely and haven't got anybody; need to find somebody to stop feeling like that; need to know best places to find somebody; research ways to meet people and put self into that situation. Or feel worthless; being of use to someone or something would make me feel less worthless; dedicate myself to making myself of use to someone who needs somebody; use free time aiding charity or institution where people need you, and you can feel needed. Honestly, I know it's not that easy a fix, and there will be more bumps to overcome. One of my larger problems is isolation and loneliness, and even having looked at places to go, I still haven't found the courage to put myself into a situation to meet people. But generating a simple starting point where you can do something easily achievable, even just through reading online about how to get started, can make you feel proactive and start to get you into a more productive feeling that maybe it won't be like that forever, and that there is a physical, tangible, mortal way to deal with the situation. So, I would recommend pick a small goal that CAN lead to some form of happiness and work towards that, rather than try to envision this great milestone of achieving happiness in one big leap. Helps you take it day by day a little easier, and I hope that would make each new day, if not better, at least consistent for you.

"Starting new meds and looking at about a month more of hell.. So I was getting ready to switch meds when I had to switch insurance.

Please use a sterile blade if you're going to cut yourself, and don't go any deeper than just the surface skin.

I also recommend other methods, there are plenty out there that can cause some pretty gnarly pain but are far, far safer than cutting. Are there any taps in your house that have overly hot water? Boiling water shouldn't be used as it will scald and is just as prone to infection and other nasties as cutting, so just try clenching a fist under the regular hot water for a few seconds. On the other end of the scale I found the grabing an ice cube and squeezing as tight as I could helped!

I believe that you are not surrounding yourself with the right people, but it's true that most of the times we don't really get to choose who we meet. Having a caring heart is nothing to be ashamed of, and it would be a pity if your kindness gets lost in the midst of the crowd just because you want to fit in.

I know sometimes energy and motivation level feels out of your control, but sometimes when you're feeling low that's actually the most important time to get up and move. Today you just experienced how getting things done is what made you feel good. Too many people want to feel good first, and then act. Most times it works in the opposite way, act first and feel good after. You don't have to be at the mercy of waiting for these random days when you suddenly get something done. Make it happen. Life is like a game of momentum and inertia. Even doing something small is better than nothing. I like the mentality of trying not to have any Zero days. Don't let a day go by where you did absolutely nothing productive. It only takes something small to qualify as more than zero. And then it becomes fun trying to keep going and not letting any days slip by. Setting small goals is a good way to get moving. Large goals can seem overwhelming. Trick yourself by saying you're just going to start with 5 minutes, and often times you'll end up doing a lot more.",0,Good work.|,Good work.,Good work.

"Life without Joy. I've been dealing with depression for (at least) three years now, with varying levels of severity. There have been some real lows, but I know that's to be expected. What concerns me more than the presence of these lows, however, is the complete absence of highs. In other words, I feel no joy whatsoever. I really don't remember the last time I did. Despite seeing a counselor regularly, working out 2-3 times each week, meditating daily, and trying out multiple medications, I've seen no improvement in that regard. It takes a lot for me to do all of those things, so it's obviously pretty discouraging that I'm not seeing any results. Anyone else have this issue?","I feel only bad things, too. I can laugh and joke with my buddies, but it just feels hollow and empty on the inside.

"People with no depression think that time is limitless. After a lot of thinking, I figure that a lot of people who don't suffer depression don't have the sense of time. There is just not enough time during the day (or year) to get to where you want or achieve what you want.

Recognize that your speech is under your control, and that cries for help can just as easily become lashing out. We love you, but loving us back involves making an effort not to give your worst ramblings air time.",0,,,

I know the feeling, though can't be sure that's what you're worried about. Maybe it's about meeting people? People can be stupid, demanding and stuff. Sometimes, even friends can feel like a burden to some people. Doesn't mean they hate their friends, it just drains them to constantly have to cater to their friends to keep them. Maybe being in bed is just your favorite activity. You're addicted to it, just like people being addicted to video games. It makes you feel good to just lie there, as opposed to everything else. When you leave it, you suffer withdrawals. In that case, your best bet is to force yourself for three weeks. I know it's hard, but that's literally the only way to change it.

What is it like to seek help as a minor. 14 years old and am depressed and have issues with anxiety and self harm. If i tried to seek help with a doctor what process would I go through and what would most likely happen. in the U.S. if it makes a difference,"it *probably* depends on the state (edit: what state in the US). being 14, you are going to be tethered to your parent/guardian legally. the therapist/counselor/psychologist will be legally required to tell your guardians of anything that serves of specific risk. for example, i told my therapist that i was suicidal and he had to contact my mother and explain the basics of the situation. for self harm, im not sure exactly how/if the information would be disclosed by the therapist/counselor/psychologist to your parents.. but im assuming if you are physically hurting yourself to a GREAT EXTENT then yes, it would most likely be disclosed. im 18 now, and started seeing my on-campus(university) therapist and psychiatrist at the beginning of the school year, where i was 17. it sucks not being in control of your life, but what can you do, you know? if getting to see a therapist is an issue, i would recommend asking to talk to your doctor/pediatrician in private (during a normal check-up) and say tht youve had symptoms of depression/anxiety and you'd like to have some help talking to your parent about getting help. if it's not an issue of talking to your parent/guardian, then what's the worry? if you cant see a doctor, a school counselor could help you have this conversation with your parent! or even a supportive teacher that you trust. i went through a very similar situation when i was younger, and very much regret not being more persistent about getting help when i needed it. it mght not go away, and with school only getting harder and more stressful as you age, it's *really hard* to deal with all this emotional baggage. everyone deserves to feel the best that they can. you dont want to suffer anymore and someday you wont! feel free to pm me, i'd be happy to be your pen-pal through all this &lt;3",0,"everyone deserves to feel the best that they can. you dont want to suffer anymore and someday you wont! feel free to pm me, i'd be happy to be your pen-pal through all this <3|","everyone deserves to feel the best that they can. you dont want to suffer anymore and someday you wont! feel free to pm me, i'd be happy to be your pen-pal through all this <3","everyone deserves to feel the best that they can. you dont want to suffer anymore and someday you wont! feel free to pm me, i'd be happy to be your pen-pal through all this <3"

When does it get better?. I wasted the 'best years of my life' in highschool being depressed. Now I'm equally depressed in uni when I should be having even more fun partying and learning new things. What am I waiting for? Being even more depressed in an office job? It's too much..,"That whole best years of your life thing, at least in my opinion, is a load of hogwash. Best years? Body going through changes? Trying to figure out your first relationships? Stuck in school all day? Drama everywhere? Restricted in everything you want to do? Inexperienced enough to not know what you really want to do? I could go on... HS sucks. With very few exceptions, the only people I know who consider HS the best years are people who are completely and totally miserable adults who are looking back with rose-colored glasses at a time when their parents paid for everything. College is better for most people, but the partying and crap is highly overrated once you're old enough to look back a bit. I don't know anyone who misses that stuff. But what are the best years? I think once you hit your mid-20s things really start to look up. Odds are, your career is at least starting to actually materialize, you aren't as emotionally immature anymore and things don't bother you like they used to, and generally speaking the odds are that things are more stable overall. Don't sell your future short--you'll look back and realize there's a lot of crap in HS/college that you'll be glad to have behind you!!",0,Don't sell your future short--you'll look back and realize there's a lot of crap in HS/college that you'll be glad to have behind you!!|,Don't sell your future short--you'll look back and realize there's a lot of crap in HS/college that you'll be glad to have behind you!!,Don't sell your future short--you'll look back and realize there's a lot of crap in HS/college that you'll be glad to have behind you!!
"is having an episode a reason to take a few days off?. Its never been as bad as right now, i detest myself. i honestly couldn't see me going to work like that tomorrow. so is that reason enough?",I think that avoiding work to sit at home in your misery is a bad thing. Getting out of the house is recommended even if it's something like going to work. Obviously do whatever you feel is best but I don't think skipping work is going to help you get any better. For example I could barely get out of bed this morning to go to work but even though I'm here hating it I would alternatively be at home sleeping until 2pm then lay in bed on my phone all day.,0,,,

I am not a prisoner in these situations. I am free. I can leave whenever I want. But sometimes I realize I panic because of no logical reason. I tell that myself. Than I make a breathing exercise and it calms down. My therapist told me, when you have the feeling of not getting enough air breath through a straw.

I showered today for the first time this week. I still feel like shit,"I think people are meant to regularly bathe. Like we have probably been bathing while still hairy and grunting. I wasn't raised the best; one thing is that I was never taught to bathe regularly. It was normal to bathe once every 2-4 weeks growing up. Basically, I never had it ingrained into me, which led to being super hygienic to the point of irritation and skin problems during puberty, and complete abandonment of hygiene during my intense depressive periods. So during these periods I would go as long as I could possibly can without showering until it was literally affecting everything I did, usually 4-6 weeks. My dirtiness would get into my eyes, and they would burn like hell. I got more skin problems from the build up of dead skin: in grown hairs, dry scaly skin, acne, etc. My hair had issues too: unhealthy and wiry possibly from an unhealthy scalp and follicles and dandruff. My dick had some infection and itched like hell. I also looked like shit too and was never prepared for events that forced me to go outside which made everything worse (I would hide and wait out people who potentially could see or interact with me, for example). I also was dirty and made my surroundings just as dirty, and I smelled bad, but luckily I don't have volatile BO. *Anyways*, just saying that there are some serious consequences to poor hygiene that I wish someone told me about.

Does anyone have a chronic physical condition and suffers from depression?. I do and I'm just morbidly curious as to know if there is anyone that feels their overarching condition physiologically or psychologically affects them.,I'm locked in a viscous cycle between my physical and mental illnesses. Been diagnosed with major depressive disorder for close to 5 years now. About 2 years ago I developed a movement disorder. It has been documented but not yet diagnosed as doctors haven't figured out anything about it. The depression triggers the non epileptic seizures which cause major disturbances in my life. Crippling my quality of life and reducing what I can do. This feeds into my depression. More negative mental health the worse and more frequent the seizure like symptoms happen. Also have bad tremors and ticks in relation to the non epileptic seizures. I often fall down and have issues walking and standing. Can barely leave my home. Am reduces to limit movement inside my home which has caused weight gain from decrease movements which also stregnthens my depression which in return causes more seizure like episodes. No medication helps my mental or physical health. It actually worsens both. I am going without treatment because doctors refuse to take it seriously or are completely dumbfounded. It has been over a year since anything was prescribed to attempt to help me. Seen several specialist. This terrible cycle has lead me to multiple suicide attempts in the last few months.,0,,,

Fuck. When you try to relate but you'd rather kill yourself.,"hi there, forgive me if I'm wrong with regards to what you are referring to. How I understand your statement is that you try to relate to others but rather do the latter. If this is the case, I want to let you know that even though sometimes you feel you are compelled to relate to other because of societal pressures, you really don't and it depends to what extent. It's important to be who you are and be with people where you can be who you are. But that doesn't mean your depressed you is who you are as a person. Your depression is only a part of who you are, not your defining being. Don't define yourself as 'a depressed person' but more so 'a person that has depression right now at this stage of my life.' Because depression goes away or can be managed very well where it doesn't intrude on your life in a daily or constant basis. You are much more than your depression. Try to take smell steps that you are comfortable with and learn some coping strategies in managing depressed feelings. Ideally it'll be great if you can see a therapist but I understand that has it's own restrains. The key thing is to never give up on yourself because when you believe, there will be a way out of this.

I need a balance of alone time and time with friends to start feeling like myself again, and if I get that balance wrong I can meltdown.

For example, inflate things for the sake of a conversation with some crisis volunteer or something, just to get some free sympathy and support that I have to feel weird about later because I see that person again. But, if a friend asks me how doing, my first reaction is to reply I have good friends so they call me out on this. I self sabotage by missing appointments or shutting out natural light. If cold, thirsty, hungry or uncomfortable, I ignore it and let myself suffer. I know getting better when I start doing certain things for myself. If I make myself some tea or get more blankets or sit somewhere other than my bed, I tell myself because I care about myself and want to feel better. I have physical pain associated with depression, usually I feel an ache in my arms and legs. When I have the energy I stretch to alleviate it. This also helps me feel better.

This my first rodeo, though, prepared. learned that there are plenty of little things I can do that feel like self care. Self care is not always an elaborate bath with essential oils and red wine.

I like to start small, take control of whatever I can. Control is empowering. It could be a simple as just playing the shit out of a stupid flash game, or clearing out all the spam in your email, or reorganising your room. Just find something to keep yourself moving. Writing can help too, just lay it all out there. Seeing your words outside your head can help break the downward spiral of thinking.

Maybe a text, maybe an email, just remind yourself that you are not alone. It's a shitty battle but stick it out if you can. If you have a therapist try reaching out to one, and if you don't then see if you can get a friend or a parent to help you find one.

"I can't figure out what's going on right now...am I just unlucky?. So I've been dealing with terrible apathy and overall lack of interest with things such as school lately. I don't know if my medicines are working but it's been really difficult to get out of bed and make it to class lately. It's reached a point wherein it becomes so overcoming that I feel so powerless.

Emotionally abused people. Please tell me your stories if you feel like it. Who abused you? How it affects you? I want to prove myself that my case is not that bad and i can make it.,"I'm game and need to vent so here goes... I was verbally, physically and emotionally abused for as long as I can recall. Since you asked about emotional abuse I will focus solely on that. I was blamed constantly for everything that was wrong with the family. My mother told me this numerous times after she and my father would have huge, physically violent fights that started over events that had nothing to do with me. I was constantly told If you had a brain you would be dangerous. by my mother. Not after I'd done anything, not after a stupid act or action on my part but just in passing. This was my mother's assesment of me and she told me this frequently. I was tested, determined to have a high IQ, placed in gifted and talented classes and made to suffer for it by narcissistic, superficial, egotistical mother for my entire life. If I vot an A I was told it was because the work was too easy for me, if I got a B it was because I was lazy and never applied myself. I would constantly be accused of thinking I was So smart. Nothing I ever did or attempted to do was good enough, there was always some flaw in it. I only received criticism, never any praise. In 4th grade I had lovely long hair, my mother decided I should have it all cut off. She took me to a beauty school and had them cut all of my hair off, a boy cut, they shaved the back of my neck. My mom cried afterward and said she was crying because The haircut showed how ugly I was. The next week we were going into our small town to pick up this giant fancy framed picture for our living room, My mom made me walk on the opposite side of the street after we got out of the car. She said, I don't want to be seen with you and have people know you are my daughter. My mother really values externak beauty. I was a skinny unremarlable child, I never forgot the other side of the street incident, I had to look at the damn framed picture that we picked up that day until I moved away from home and got married at age 19. Every time I saw it I thought of that day. Years of torture. I was a divorced single mother, my ex never paid a dime, not any of the support we were supposed to receive. I worked two jobs to support us. I never received any financial help from anyone. I crafted a nice career for myself and tried to be a good mom and a good person. I never drank, never did drugs or ran around or went wild or got in any trouble. But my mother was/is ashamed of me and made/makes sure to let me know it. Anyone she talks about to me she lets me know how successful their children are, how wealthy they are and how proud the parents are. My mom told me one day how disappointed she was with how I'd turned out, how she always thought I'd be someone when I grew up. She said she'd hoped I would've grown up to marry a doctor or lawyer or someone important. I told her I was someone. At the time I was an online database adminstrator with a nationally recognized nonprofit but to my mother I was an embarrassment, a nothing and a nobody. My mother's father, my grandfather was one of the only people in my life that was always kind to me, he treated me like I was special and had value. My mother knew I adored him and she hated that he liked me. After he died she insisted on telling me horrible things about him saying she wanted me to know what kind of man the grandfather I worshipped really was and that I should not feel special that some thing like him tolerated me better than most. Right after I was divorced, I was not yet employed full time and very poor. I was visifing my parents at their huge house in the country. My mother started bitching about how poor I was, I had not asked her or dad for a dime and I was not there to eat. Mom started talking about dying, asked me if I had a sill, etc.. Mom told me I better not die because she did not want to have to spend her money on a funeral for me, and she said not that anyone would show up at a funeral for me anyway. She also told me that she'd always thought of me as a living abortion, since my birth. She was going nuts, yelling and spitting. She told me she bet I was so poor, such a failure that I probably could not even afford feminine products. I got my purse to leave, opened it and hurled a few tampons at her, as I told her, wrong bitch. My father blocked the front door, and tried to make me apologise to my mother. I had to threaten to call the police before he would let me go. After my father passed away my mother called, she said she needed to ask me something. Then mom said, Did you ever think or get the feeling that your father really loved you or cared about you? I told my mom that yes, yes I did. That dad was a fifties guy and although he may not have ever been emotionally demonstrative I thought he did love and care about me. He has worked hard and made personal sacrifices to care for us financially when I was young. That there had been a few occassions that he'd been very nice to me. Like going into a shop and buying me a top he knew I wanted for my 16th Birthday. Buying me a computer, working with me on computer projects early on, buying us both laptops, teaching me to shoot and fish, and by his having special nicknames and greetings for me, etc.. I told mom that was how dad expressed his love. My mother said, That's interesting because I always had the impression that he didn't care about you at all. I was also emotionally abused by my father, it was different than my mother's abuse though. My dad alwsys had to be the best. He could not stand for me to be good at anything I could never, ever be as good as he was or (god fobid it) better. My parents were never involved in our education. They basically just asked us at dinner how school was and we'd say OK and dinner would proceed. I should have known from past events not to dare say anything positive had happened but one day I was happy and excited about something that had happened at school, in English class. I was so excited that I stupidly spoke up at dinner. When the standard, How was school? question was asked I boldly said, School was great, Mrs. G, my English teacher pulled me aside after class. She told me a poem I'd written for an assignment was so good they want my permission to publish it on the first page of the student yearbook! My father put his fork down, he tilted his head, gave me a bizarre look and told me to recite the poem. I could not recite it, I was too nervous and afraid. I said I would show it to him after dinner, it was no big deal. No, dad wanted to hear this fabulous poem I had written, right then. I went and got the poem and started to read it out loud. Dad told me to give it to him to read. He told me if it was in the yearbook people woukd be reading it for themselves. Dad read it silently and then while scoffing and half laughing he read it aloud. Dad asked me if the idiots at my school really thought that was good writing? He said he bet he could write something right then that would be a hundred times better. Dad left the table and went to his desk while we all sat at the table waiting for his return. After about twenty minutes Dad cheerfully returned, poem in hand. He stood and read it to us. It was some lame poem with Brother can you spare me a dime as one of the lines. Dad then told us, See, that's a poem, that's what good poetry is like! After that he asked all of us, Wasn't my poem better, a lot better? We all agreed, and lied and said his poem was a lot better. I told the English teacher not to let them use my poem for the yearbook. I never wrote another poem or much else for that matter. That crap happened in 1975 and I am still not over it despite counseling. Another thing that was a form of emotional abuse was the family hierarchy. My father came first, then my sister or mother, then me. I.always came last, even though I was the eldest child. There was this thing with the food. If we had any serving size type of meat it came into play. Let's say it is steaks for dinner, they are on a platter. The largest steak is for Dad, younger sister gets the next largest, mom third largest and smallest was for me. It was like that with all of the food. It was an unwritten rule. I decided to challenge it once when the platter of Hamburgers was beside me. I knew better than to go for the one for Dad but tried to take the secind largest one. My mom was immediately shrieking at me, No, no, put that back, it's for your sister! Yours is the small one. My parents home has our family pictures hanging in the study, they are hung vertically on one wall. The order is from top to bottom, a picture of my dad, a picture of my mom, a picture of my sister, a picture of my son, then a picture of me. I.am at the very bottom, like always. I.endured physical, emotional and mental abuse. I've seen therapist on occasion over the years and at one point was in therapy sessions twice a week for a year. It helped but it hasn't enabled me forget. I just have to deal with what happened and move forward. I'm not social, I don't really trust anyone or have any close friends but I'm okay with that. TLDR: Emotionally abused, made me tough, I survived it with a bit of therapy. Edit: Added TLDR",0,,,

"What do you hate most about depression?. Probably the blank periods of thought I go through. Completely devoid of emotion and any mental activity. It can last for a good half an hour, really annoying as it's stopped me from reading.","That it has stripped me of a personality. I used to like reading, going to the gym, animals, etc. Now I don't enjoy anything. I'm an empty shell, I don't like anything, I don't hate anything (except myself). I'm just... there. Like a piece of furniture.",0,,,
